## 2. Publish Operation

### 2.1 Full End-to-End Flow

Current implementation note: the code path today is a **single-node publish
submission** with local data storage first, then a direct
`publishKnowledgeAssets(...)` call. The publisher currently signs both the
publisher commitment and the receiver-attestation payload with its configured
EVM wallet before submitting on-chain. Gossip then distributes the result to
other nodes. Receiver-side confirmation currently happens only through the
targeted on-chain verification in `GossipPublishHandler`; `ChainEventPoller`
confirms local pending publishes tracked by `PublishHandler`, not gossip-only
tentative data.

    Agent->>Agent: encodePublishRequest(paranetId, nquads, ual, chainInfo?)
    Agent->>GS: publish(paranetPublishTopic, encodedMsg)
```

Important implementation details reflected in code:

- There is only **one protocol publish** in this flow:
  `publishKnowledgeAssets(...)` is the actual on-chain publish. The final
  `GossipSub.publish(...)` call is just peer-to-peer replication of that result.
- In the current implementation, gossip replication happens after
  `DKGPublisher.publish()` returns, regardless of whether the result is
  `confirmed` or `tentative`.
- The publisher inserts **data first** and writes tentative metadata only if the
  on-chain step fails or is unavailable.
- The on-chain publish path uses `publishKnowledgeAssets(...)`, not a separate
  `reserveUALRange(...)` + `batchMintKnowledgeAssets(...)` sequence in the
  current `DKGPublisher.publish()` implementation.
- `ownedEntities` and `knownBatchParanets` are updated only on confirmed local
  publishes.
- Broadcasts contain **public quads only**; private triples stay in the private
  store.

That means the final network step is best read as: "replicate the current local
publish result to peers," not "perform the publish."

### 2.2 RDF Triples Produced

#### Data Graph: `did:dkg:paranet:{paranetId}`

User-supplied triples, normalized to the paranet graph:

```turtle

## 3. Gossip-Based Publish Propagation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Pub as Publisher Node
    participant GS as GossipSub Mesh
    participant R1 as Receiver Node 1
    participant R2 as Receiver Node 2
    participant Chain as Chain

    Pub->>GS: publish(paranetPublishTopic, PublishRequest)

    Note over GS: PublishRequest contains:<br/>ual, paranetId, nquads, manifest,<br/>publisherIdentity, publisherAddress,<br/>startKAId, endKAId, chainId,<br/>txHash, blockNumber

    GS-->>R1: PublishRequest
    GS-->>R2: PublishRequest

    Note over R1: Phase 1 — Decode + structural validation

    R1->>R1: Decode PublishRequest
    R1->>R1: Validate: paranetId matches subscription
    R1->>R1: Parse N-Triples/N-Quads payload
    R1->>R1: validatePublishRequest(...)
    R1->>R1: Query local data graph for Rule 4 replay/conflict check

    Note over R1: Phase 2 — Tentative insert

    R1->>R1: Insert public data unless this is a replay
    R1->>R1: Recompute Merkle root from received payload
    R1->>R1: generateTentativeMetadata(ual, manifest)
    R1->>R1: Store meta with dkg:status "tentative"

    Note over R1: Phase 3 — Targeted on-chain verification (optional)

    alt PublishRequest includes txHash + blockNumber
        R1->>Chain: listenForEvents({fromBlock: blockNumber, toBlock: blockNumber, eventTypes: [KnowledgeBatchCreated]})
        Chain-->>R1: KnowledgeBatchCreated event
        R1->>R1: Verify txHash, merkleRoot, publisherAddress, KA range
        R1->>R1: promoteGossipToConfirmed()
        R1->>R1: Swap dkg:status "tentative" → "confirmed"
    else No chain info in message
        R1->>R1: Stay tentative, register for ChainEventPoller
    end

    Note over R1: Phase 4 — Tentative timeout (60 min)

    alt Not confirmed within 60 min
        R1->>R1: Remove tentative data + metadata
    end
```

> **REVIEW: Tentative data retention.**
> The 60-minute timeout is a reasonable default, but:
> - If a publisher is slow to get on-chain (gas spikes, mempool congestion),
>   valid data may be dropped before the chain event arrives.
> - Consider making the timeout configurable and/or adding a re-request
>   mechanism via the sync protocol.

Current implementation details:

- Receivers do **not** trust gossip-supplied on-chain status; they always store
  gossip-received publishes as tentative first.
- `GossipPublishHandler` promotes tentative metadata by swapping status quads.
  It does **not** currently append full chain provenance during gossip-based
  promotion.
- Replay publishes are tolerated: if validation failures are all Rule 4
  conflicts, the handler treats the message as a replay and skips duplicate data
  insertion while still attempting verification.

## 4. Chain Event Confirmation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Poller as ChainEventPoller
    participant Chain as EVM Adapter
    participant PH as PublishHandler
    participant Store as TripleStore

    loop Every 12 seconds
        Poller->>Poller: Check pending publishes / paranet watcher
        alt Has pending publishes or paranet watcher enabled
            Poller->>Chain: getBlockNumber()
            Poller->>Chain: listenForEvents({fromBlock: lastBlock+1, toBlock: upperBound, eventTypes})

            loop For each KnowledgeBatchCreated event
                Chain-->>Poller: {merkleRoot, publisherAddress, startKAId, endKAId, blockNumber}
                Poller->>PH: confirmByMerkleRoot(merkleRoot, chainData)
                PH->>PH: Find pending publish with matching merkleRoot
                alt Match found
                    PH->>Store: Delete dkg:status "tentative"
                    PH->>Store: Insert dkg:status "confirmed"
                    PH-->>Poller: confirmed = true
                else No match
                    PH-->>Poller: confirmed = false
                end
            end

            opt ParanetCreated observed
                Poller->>Poller: invoke onParanetCreated callback
            end

            Poller->>Poller: Advance lastBlock to scanned upperBound
        end
    end
```

Current implementation details:

- The poller only starts work when there are pending publishes or a paranet
  discovery callback is configured.
- On first successful head lookup, if there are no pending publishes, it seeds
  the cursor near the tip instead of scanning full history.
- Publish confirmation is a **status-only promotion** in `PublishHandler`:
  delete tentative status, insert confirmed status, clear timeout, persist the
  pending-publish journal.

### Chain Events Emitted

| Event | Source Contract | Fields | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|--------|---------|
| `KnowledgeBatchCreated` | KnowledgeAssetsStorage | batchId, publisher, merkleRoot, startKAId, endKAId, txHash | Confirm published data |
| `UALRangeReserved` | KnowledgeAssetsStorage | publisher, startId, endId | UAL allocation |
| `ParanetCreated` | ParanetV9Registry | paranetId, creator, accessPolicy | Discover new paranets |
| `KnowledgeBatchUpdated` | KnowledgeAssetsStorage | batchId, newMerkleRoot | Confirm data updates |

## 5. Workspace Writes

```mermaid

    participant Agent as DKGAgent
    participant WH as WorkspaceHandler
    participant Store as TripleStore
    participant GS as GossipSub

    App->>Agent: writeToWorkspace(paranetId, quads)

    Agent->>Agent: Encode WorkspacePublishRequest
    Agent->>Agent: Set publisherPeerId = myPeerId
    Agent->>Agent: Auto-partition quads by rootEntity

    Note over Agent: Local write

    Agent->>WH: handle(encodedRequest, myPeerId)
    WH->>WH: Validate: publisherPeerId === fromPeerId
    WH->>WH: autoPartition(quads)
    WH->>WH: Validate: Rules 1-5 (same as publish)
    WH->>WH: Check workspaceOwnedEntities for upsert rights

    alt Upsert — entity already exists, owned by this peer
        WH->>Store: deleteByPattern(workspace graph, rootEntity)
        WH->>Store: deleteBySubjectPrefix(workspace graph, rootEntity + skolemized)
        WH->>WH: Delete prior workspace_meta ops for this root
    end

    WH->>Store: insert(quads → workspace graph)
    WH->>Store: insert(metaQuads → workspace_meta graph)
    WH->>WH: Update workspaceOwnedEntities map

    Note over Agent: Broadcast to network

    Agent->>GS: publish(paranetWorkspaceTopic, encodedRequest)

    Note over GS: Other nodes receive and run same WH.handle()
```

### Workspace Meta Triples

```turtle
# Workspace meta graph: did:dkg:paranet:{paranetId}/_workspace_meta

<urn:dkg:workspace:{paranetId}:{opId}>
    rdf:type              dkg:WorkspaceOperation ;
    prov:wasAttributedTo  "12D3KooW..." ;
    dkg:publishedAt       "2026-03-08T11:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    dkg:rootEntity        <https://example.org/entity/1> ;
    dkg:rootEntity        <https://example.org/entity/2> .
```

> **Implementation note: Workspace access control.**
> The current model is creator-only upsert — only the original publisher can
> overwrite their entities. This is enforced via `workspaceOwnedEntities`
> (`Map<paranetId, Map<rootEntity, creatorPeerId>>`) and persisted into
> `/_workspace_meta` with `dkg:workspaceOwner` / `prov:wasAttributedTo` triples.
> `DKGPublisher.reconstructWorkspaceOwnership()` rebuilds the in-memory map on
> startup from those persisted ownership records.

## 6. Update Operation

There are two distinct concerns in an update flow:

1. **Owner authorization** — only the batch publisher is allowed to change the
   KC on-chain.
2. **State safety** — if other nodes, apps, or reducers depend on the current
   version, the ecosystem may still need consensus before the owner commits the
   replacement.

On mainnet, treat `updateKnowledgeAssets` as the final commit primitive, not as
proof that the new state was socially or application-wise accepted. The chain
confirms who may update; consensus confirms whether the dependent system should
move to that update.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Agent as DKGAgent
    participant Pub as DKGPublisher
    participant Store as TripleStore
    participant Chain as EVM Adapter
    participant GS as GossipSub

    App->>Agent: update(kcId, paranetId, quads)

    Agent->>Pub: update(kcId, options)

    Pub->>Pub: Validate quads (same rules)
    Pub->>Pub: Compute new merkle root

    Pub->>Chain: updateKnowledgeAssets({batchId, newMerkleRoot, newPublicByteSize})
    Chain-->>Pub: TxResult {txHash, blockNumber}

    loop For each affected rootEntity
        Pub->>Store: Delete old data in canonical graph
        Pub->>Store: Insert replacement quads
    end

    Pub->>Store: Update meta graph (new merkle root, timestamp)
    Pub-->>Agent: PublishResult {kcId, ual, status: "confirmed"}

    Agent->>GS: publish(paranetUpdateTopic, UpdateRequest)

    Note over GS: Receivers verify via chain.verifyKAUpdate()<br/>then apply update in canonical order
```

### Why updates may need consensus first

Protocol authorization is not enough when the updated KC is a dependency for
other execution paths. If a pricing graph, policy graph, workflow state, or
shared reducer input changes underneath active consumers, a unilateral update
can create a cascading mismatch:

- one service starts using the new state,
- another still executes against the old assumptions,
- downstream validation disagrees,
- retries, compensating actions, or manual intervention follow.

That is why mainnet applications commonly gate updates behind a pre-update
consensus step whenever dependents exist.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Owner as KC Owner
    participant DepA as Dependent A
    participant DepB as Dependent B
    participant DepC as Dependent C
    participant Chain as Mainnet

    rect rgb(251, 234, 234)
        Note over Owner,DepC: No consensus gate
        Owner->>Chain: commit update U2
        Chain-->>DepA: sees U2
        Note over DepB,DepC: still executing against U1-derived assumptions
        DepA-->>DepB: emits data based on U2
        DepB-->>DepC: validation mismatch / rollback / fork
    end

    rect rgb(232, 245, 233)
        Note over Owner,DepC: Consensus gate before commit
        Owner->>DepA: propose U2
        Owner->>DepB: propose U2
        Owner->>DepC: propose U2
        DepA-->>Owner: accept
        DepB-->>Owner: accept
        DepC-->>Owner: accept
        Owner->>Chain: commit update U2 after quorum
        Chain-->>DepA: canonical U2
        Chain-->>DepB: canonical U2
        Chain-->>DepC: canonical U2
    end
```

### Mainnet-safe update policy

- **Use owner-only update directly** for isolated assets where no live process
  depends on the previous version.
- **Require consensus before update** for shared state machines, workflow
  checkpoints, pricing/policy inputs, or any asset that other parties execute
  against.
- **Broadcast the on-chain update last** so gossip acts as distribution of an
  already-agreed canonical state, not as the place where conflicts are created.

Current implementation details:

- `DKGPublisher.update()` computes the replacement Merkle root before touching
  the local store.
- It only mutates local triples after `chain.updateKnowledgeAssets(...)`
  succeeds.
- Receivers verify updates with `verifyKAUpdate(...)`, recompute the Merkle
  root from the payload, and apply updates in canonical `(blockNumber, txIndex)`
  order.

> **REVIEW: Update ordering.**
> Updates are applied in canonical `(blockNumber, txIndex)` order. This is
> correct for consistency, but there's no mechanism for conflict resolution
> if two publishers update overlapping entities in the same block. The first
> tx wins (by txIndex), but the second publisher gets no notification of
> the conflict.

## 7. Query Operation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Agent as DKGAgent
    participant QE as DKGQueryEngine
    participant Store as TripleStore

    App->>Agent: query(sparql, {paranetId, includeWorkspace?})

    Agent->>QE: query(sparql, options)

    QE->>QE: validateReadOnlySparql(sparql)
    Note over QE: Rejects: INSERT, DELETE, LOAD, CLEAR, DROP, CREATE, COPY, MOVE, ADD
    Note over QE: Accepts: SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK, DESCRIBE

    alt includeWorkspace = true
        QE->>Store: query(sparql, scoped to data graph)
        Store-->>QE: dataBindings
        QE->>Store: query(sparql, scoped to workspace graph)
        Store-->>QE: workspaceBindings
        QE->>QE: Merge: [...dataBindings, ...workspaceBindings]
    else Normal query
        QE->>QE: wrapWithGraph(sparql, dataGraphUri)
        QE->>Store: query(wrappedSparql)
        Store-->>QE: bindings
    end

    QE-->>Agent: {bindings: [...]}
    Agent-->>App: QueryResult

    Note over QE: DKGQueryEngine is local-only by design (Spec §1.6 Store Isolation)
```

### Query Access Policy

```typescript
interface ParanetQueryPolicy {
  policy: 'deny' | 'public' | 'allowList';
  allowedPeers?: string[];
  allowedLookupTypes?: LookupType[];
  sparqlEnabled?: boolean;
  sparqlTimeout?: number;
  sparqlMaxResults?: number;
}
```

### Remote Queries (cross-agent)

While `DKGQueryEngine` executes only against the local triple store, remote
queries ARE supported at the protocol and HTTP layers:

- **Protocol:** `/dkg/query/2.0.0` — peers send query requests; the receiving
  node's `QueryHandler` enforces access policy, rate limits, and SPARQL
  restrictions before delegating to its local `DKGQueryEngine`.
- **HTTP API:** `POST /api/query-remote` — applications send remote queries
  via the daemon, which routes them to the target peer over the protocol.

**Remote query restrictions** (enforced by `QueryHandler`):
- `SERVICE` clauses rejected — no federated queries across endpoints
- Explicit `GRAPH` clauses rejected — queries are auto-scoped to the target paranet
- `FROM` / `FROM NAMED` clauses rejected — same reason

> **Design note:** The query engine is intentionally local-only (Spec §1.6 Store
> Isolation). All queries run against the local store only — including published data,
> workspace data, and any other locally-held triples. Remote queries delegate execution
> to another peer's local engine — they do not provide query federation or cross-store
> joins.

### Private Access (cross-agent)

Private triple retrieval uses a separate protocol and policy path from remote query.

- **Protocol:** `/dkg/access/1.0.0` — requester sends KA UAL + signature; provider
  returns private N-Quads if access is granted.
- **Handler:** `AccessHandler` checks KA/KC metadata (`dkg:accessPolicy`,
  `dkg:publisherPeerId`, `dkg:allowedPeer`) before returning private triples.
- **Client:** `AccessClient` verifies returned triples against `privateMerkleRoot`
  when available.

Effective policy rules:

- `ownerOnly` -> only publisher peer may access.
- `allowList` -> only peers listed by KC metadata `dkg:allowedPeer` may access.
- `allowList` with missing or empty `dkg:allowedPeer` entries -> access denied.
- `public` -> any peer may request private triples for that KA.

> **Security note:** `/dkg/query/2.0.0` and `/dkg/access/1.0.0` are independent.
> A denied remote query does not imply denied private access. Access behavior is
> controlled by KC/KA access metadata.

## 8. Peer Sync

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Node A (requester)
    participant B as Node B (provider)

    Note over A,B: Data Sync — paginated text protocol over /dkg/sync/1.0.0

    A->>B: "{paranetId}|0|500"
    B->>B: Query data graph (OFFSET 0 LIMIT 500)
    B->>B: Append meta graph triples (first page only)
    B-->>A: N-Quads string (data + meta triples)

    A->>A: Parse N-Quads, accumulate

    loop Next pages until empty response or 120s total timeout
        A->>B: "{paranetId}|{offset}|500"
        B->>B: Query data graph (OFFSET {offset} LIMIT 500)
        B-->>A: N-Quads string (data triples only)
        A->>A: Parse, accumulate
        Note over A: Up to 3 retry attempts per page (exponential backoff)
    end

    Note over A: Per-KC Merkle verification:
    Note over A: 1. Try flat mode (single Merkle over all triple hashes)
    Note over A: 2. If flat fails → entity-proofs mode (per-KA roots → KC root)
    Note over A: 3. Either matching on-chain merkleRoot is sufficient

    Note over A: Partial acceptance rules:
    Note over A: • Each KC verified independently — verified KCs inserted, failed KCs rejected
    Note over A: • KCs with missing KA metadata → accepted on trust
    Note over A: • Overlapping root-entity KCs → skip Merkle, defer to chain verification
    Note over A: • System paranets → accept unverified data

    A->>A: Insert verified data into data graph
    A->>A: Insert verified metadata into meta graph
```

### Workspace Sync

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Node A
    participant B as Node B

    Note over A,B: Workspace Sync — TTL-filtered, paginated

    A->>B: "workspace:{paranetId}|0|500"
    B->>B: Query workspace + workspace_meta graphs
    B->>B: Apply TTL filter (default: 48h) — exclude expired triples
    B-->>A: N-Quads string (workspace data + meta on first page)

    loop Next pages
        A->>B: "workspace:{paranetId}|{offset}|500"
        B-->>A: N-Quads string (workspace data only)
    end

    A->>A: Validate workspace ops (require type + publishedAt)
    A->>A: Extract creator from validated ops (wasAttributedTo)
    A->>A: Insert into workspace + workspace_meta graphs
    A->>A: Update workspaceOwnedEntities from validated metadata
```

Current implementation details:

- Sync uses a plain-text request protocol: `"{paranetId}|{offset}|{limit}"` for data,
  `"workspace:{paranetId}|{offset}|{limit}"` for workspace.
- Page size is 500 triples (`SYNC_PAGE_SIZE`). Meta graph triples are included only
  on the first page (offset=0).
- Total sync timeout is 120 seconds. Each page has up to 3 retry attempts with
  exponential backoff.
- Merkle verification tries flat mode first (single tree over all triple hashes),
  then falls back to entity-proofs mode (per-KA roots → KC root). Verification is
  **per-KC** — verified KCs are inserted while failed KCs are individually rejected.
  KCs with missing KA metadata are accepted on trust; overlapping root-entity KCs
  skip Merkle verification and defer to chain-level checks.
- System paranets (e.g., agent registry) accept unverified data when the paranet
  is in the `SYSTEM_PARANETS` set.
- Workspace sync applies a configurable TTL filter (`workspaceTtlMs`, default 48h).
  Synced workspace operations are validated (require `rdf:type` + `publishedAt`),
  and creator-entity mappings are extracted to populate `workspaceOwnedEntities`,
  enabling creator-only upsert enforcement after sync.

## 9. Paranet Discovery

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as DKGAgent
    participant Chain as EVM Adapter
    participant Store as TripleStore
    participant Peer as Peer Node

    Note over Agent: Path 1 — Chain event detection (deferred)

    opt Chain available
        Agent->>Chain: ChainEventPoller observes ParanetCreated
        Chain-->>Agent: {paranetId (hash), creator, accessPolicy}
        Agent->>Agent: Record hash in seenOnChainIds (defer subscription)
        Note over Agent: Cannot subscribe yet — need cleartext paranet name
    end

    Note over Agent: Path 2 — Store-based discovery (after sync)

    Agent->>Peer: Sync ONTOLOGY paranet data
    Peer-->>Agent: Paranet definition triples
    Agent->>Store: Query ONTOLOGY graph for dkg:Paranet entities
    loop For each discovered paranet (not yet subscribed)
        Agent->>Agent: Update subscription registry (name, subscribed, synced)
        Agent->>Agent: subscribeToParanet(paranetId)
        Note over Agent: Subscribe to 4 GossipSub topics (publish, workspace, app, update)
    end

    Note over Agent: Path 3 — Chain registry scan (periodic)

    opt Chain available
        Agent->>Chain: listParanetsFromChain() — query registry for cleartext names
        loop For each paranet with resolved name
            Agent->>Agent: subscribeToParanet(name)
            Note over Agent: synced=false — data sync still needed
        end
    end

    Note over Agent: Also discovered via config file (paranets[] array)
```

## 10. GossipSub Topic Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "System Topics"
        PEERS["dkg/network/peers"]
    end

    subgraph "Per-Paranet Topics"
        PUB["dkg/paranet/{id}/publish"]
        WS["dkg/paranet/{id}/workspace"]
        APP["dkg/paranet/{id}/app"]
        UPD["dkg/paranet/{id}/update"]
        SESS["dkg/paranet/{id}/sessions"]
    end

    subgraph "Per-Session Topics"
        S1["dkg/paranet/{id}/sessions/{sid}"]
    end

    subgraph "System Paranets"
        AGENTS["dkg/paranet/agents/publish"]
        ONTO["dkg/paranet/ontology/publish"]
    end
```

| Topic | Purpose | Message Types |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `dkg/network/peers` | Peer discovery & health | Peer announce, capabilities |
| `dkg/paranet/{id}/publish` | Published data broadcast | PublishRequest (encoded protobuf) |
| `dkg/paranet/{id}/workspace` | Workspace writes | WorkspacePublishRequest |
| `dkg/paranet/{id}/app` | Application coordination | JSON app messages (game, etc.) |
| `dkg/paranet/{id}/update` | KA updates | UpdateRequest |
| `dkg/paranet/{id}/sessions` | Multi-party sessions | Session proposals, coordination |
| `dkg/paranet/{id}/sessions/{sid}` | Per-session messages | Round data, commitments |

> **Note on `dkg/network/peers`:** The topic constant is defined (`networkPeersTopic()`)
> but has no publish, subscribe, or handler usage on this branch. It is reserved for
> future peer discovery but not currently active.

> **Note on sessions topics:** The base `subscribeToParanet()` flow does NOT subscribe
> to sessions topics. The attested-assets layer can subscribe the paranet-level sessions
> topic (`dkg/paranet/{id}/sessions`) via `SessionManager.subscribeParanet()`. Per-session
> topics (`dkg/paranet/{id}/sessions/{sid}`) are subscribed when a session is created or
> a proposal is received.

> **REVIEW: App topic is untyped.**
> The `app` topic carries JSON messages with an `app` field for routing (e.g.
> `"origin-trail-game"`). All apps on the same paranet share a single topic.
> **Risk:** A malicious app could flood the topic, affecting all apps. Consider
> per-app subtopics: `dkg/paranet/{id}/app/{appId}`.

## 11. Storage Model

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Triple Store (Oxigraph)"
        subgraph "Paranet: origin-trail-game"
            DATA["Data Graph<br/>did:dkg:paranet:origin-trail-game<br/>Published triples + player profiles"]
            META["Meta Graph<br/>.../_meta<br/>KC/KA metadata, merkle roots, status"]
            PRIV["Private Graph<br/>.../_private<br/>Publisher-only triples"]
            WS["Workspace Graph<br/>.../_workspace<br/>Swarms, memberships, votes"]
            WS_META["Workspace Meta<br/>.../_workspace_meta<br/>Operation tracking"]
        end

        subgraph "Context Graphs (per swarm)"
            CTX["did:dkg:paranet:.../context/{swarmId}<br/>Turn results (published)"]
            CTX_META["...context/{swarmId}/_meta<br/>Turn result metadata"]
        end
    end
```

### Graph URI Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Content |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `did:dkg:paranet:{id}` | `did:dkg:paranet:origin-trail-game` | Published data |
| `did:dkg:paranet:{id}/_meta` | `.../_meta` | KC/KA metadata |
| `did:dkg:paranet:{id}/_private` | `.../_private` | Private triples |
| `did:dkg:paranet:{id}/_workspace` | `.../_workspace` | Workspace data |
| `did:dkg:paranet:{id}/_workspace_meta` | `.../_workspace_meta` | Workspace ops |
| `did:dkg:paranet:{id}/context/{ctxId}` | `.../context/swarm-abc123` | Context graph data |
| `did:dkg:paranet:{id}/context/{ctxId}/_meta` | `.../context/swarm-abc123/_meta` | Context graph meta |

`_private` graph behavior:

- Not included in normal peer sync (`/dkg/sync/1.0.0`) or standard query replication.
- Retrieved only through `/dkg/access/1.0.0` when access policy permits.

## 12. Merkle Tree & Proof System

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Knowledge Collection (KC)"
        KC_ROOT["KC Merkle Root<br/>(published on-chain)"]
    end

    subgraph "Knowledge Assets (KAs)"
        KA1["KA Root 1"]
        KA2["KA Root 2"]
        KA3["KA Root 3"]
    end

    subgraph "KA1 Internals"
        PUB1["Public Root<br/>sha256(sorted triple hashes)"]
        PRIV1["Private Root<br/>sha256(sorted private triple hashes)"]
    end

    subgraph "KA2 Internals (public only)"
        PUB2["Public Root"]
    end

    subgraph "KA3 Internals (private only)"
        PRIV3["Private Root"]
    end

    KC_ROOT --- KA1
    KC_ROOT --- KA2
    KC_ROOT --- KA3

    KA1 --- PUB1
    KA1 --- PRIV1
    KA2 --- PUB2
    KA3 --- PRIV3
```

### Merkle Computation

1. **Triple hash:** SHA-256 of the NQuad serialization of each triple.
2. **Public root:** Merkle tree over sorted triple hashes for a rootEntity.
3. **Private root:** Merkle tree over sorted private triple hashes (publisher-only).
4. **KA root:** `sha256(publicRoot || privateRoot)` — or just the one that exists.
5. **KC root:** Merkle tree over sorted KA roots.
6. **On-chain:** Only the KC root (32 bytes) goes on-chain.

### Verification

```
Verifier receives: quads[], metadata{merkleRoot, kaManifest[]}

For each KA in manifest:
  1. Filter quads for rootEntity + skolemized children
  2. Hash each quad → sorted list
  3. Build merkle tree → publicRoot
  4. KA root = computeKARoot(publicRoot, privateMerkleRoot?)

Collect KA roots → sorted → build merkle tree → kcRoot
Compare kcRoot === metadata.merkleRoot ✓
```

> **REVIEW: Entity-proofs mode.**
> When `entityProofs: true`, each KA has its own sub-tree enabling selective
> disclosure (prove entity 2 without revealing entity 1). This is powerful
> but adds overhead. Currently off by default — consider making it the default
> for paranets with privacy requirements.

## 13. On-Chain vs Off-Chain Data

### On-Chain (Base Sepolia)

| Data | Contract | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| KC Merkle Root | KnowledgeAssetsStorage | Integrity anchor — verifies off-chain data hasn't been tampered |
| KA token range | KnowledgeAssetsStorage | NFT ownership — startKAId to endKAId |
| Publisher address | KnowledgeAssetsStorage | Attribution — who published this data |
| Batch ID | KnowledgeAssetsStorage | Sequential ordering |
| Paranet ID | ParanetV9Registry | Paranet existence and access policy |
| TRAC stake | Token contract | Storage payment |
| Identity ID | Identity contract | DID ↔ on-chain identity binding |

### Off-Chain (Triple Store + GossipSub)

| Data | Storage | Propagation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Published triples | Data graph | GossipSub publish topic |
| KC/KA metadata | Meta graph | GossipSub publish topic |
| Private triples | Private graph | NEVER propagated (publisher only) |
| Workspace data | Workspace graph | GossipSub workspace topic |
| App messages | In-memory | GossipSub app topic |

Access-policy linkage (off-chain):

- Access control for private triples is encoded in KC/KA metadata in `_meta`
  (e.g., `dkg:accessPolicy`, `dkg:publisherPeerId`).
- Registry-level paranet `accessPolicy` on-chain governs paranet registration/discovery
  semantics and should not be treated as a substitute for KA private data access checks.

### What Gets Linked (and What Doesn't)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "On-Chain"
        MR["merkleRoot<br/>0xabc..."]
        TX["txHash<br/>0xdef..."]
        BN["blockNumber<br/>12345678"]
        BATCH["batchId: 7"]
        ADDR["publisher<br/>0x1234..."]
        NFT["KA tokens<br/>#42..#44"]
    end

    subgraph "Meta Graph (linked)"
        KC["KC metadata<br/>dkg:status, dkg:merkleRoot,<br/>dkg:transactionHash, dkg:blockNumber,<br/>dkg:publisherAddress, dkg:batchId"]
    end

    subgraph "Data Graph (NOT linked)"
        DATA["User triples<br/>No reference to chain provenance"]
    end

    MR -.->|confirmed| KC
    TX -.->|confirmed| KC
    BN -.->|confirmed| KC
    BATCH -.->|confirmed| KC
    ADDR -.->|confirmed| KC

    KC -->|"dkg:partOf"| DATA

    style DATA fill:#3a2020,color:#e6edf3
```

> **REVIEW: Data-to-chain linking gap.**
> User-facing data triples have NO direct link to their on-chain proof.
> To verify a triple's on-chain status, an app must:
> 1. Find the rootEntity of the triple
> 2. Look up the KA in the meta graph by rootEntity
> 3. Follow `dkg:partOf` to the KC
> 4. Read `dkg:transactionHash` from the KC
>
> This is workable but fragile. A convenience triple on each rootEntity
> pointing to its KA would simplify queries:
> ```turtle
> <rootEntity>  dkg:knowledgeAsset  <ual/tokenId> .
> ```

## 14. Protocol-Level Review & Improvements

### 14.1 Publish Flow

| # | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------|----------------|
| P1 | Tentative data dropped after 60 min if chain is slow | Medium | Make timeout configurable; add re-request via sync protocol |
| P2 | No publish receipt/ACK from receivers | Low | Consider adding a lightweight gossip ACK for publisher visibility |
| P3 | Gossip publish can be replayed (no nonce/dedup) | Medium | Add `operationId` + dedup window to GossipSub handlers |
| P4 | `broadcastPublish` uses retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 500ms base); large payloads may still fail | Medium | Consider chunking large publish payloads or using direct protocol for big KCs |

### 14.2 Workspace

| # | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------|----------------|
| W1 | ~~`workspaceOwnedEntities` is in-memory only~~ | ~~High~~ | **RESOLVED** — ownership is persisted to `workspace_meta` and reconstructed on startup via `reconstructWorkspaceOwnership()` |
| W2 | ~~No TTL on workspace data~~ | ~~Medium~~ | **RESOLVED** — TTL is implemented (default 48h). Cleanup runs every 15 minutes, pruning expired workspace ops, their data triples, and ownership entries |
| W3 | No workspace versioning | Low | Track version/revision per rootEntity for optimistic concurrency |

### 14.3 Consensus / Game

| # | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------|----------------|
| C1 | Leader controls random seed — can manipulate game events | Medium | Use VRF seeded by collective randomness (hash of all votes) |
| C2 | No explicit rejection message for proposals | Medium | Add `turn:reject` message type with reason |
| C3 | `expedition:launched` game state is gossip-only | High | Write to workspace so late-joining nodes can catch up |
| C4 | Turn results don't include chain provenance | High | After publish, write txHash/ual/blockNumber to context graph |
| C5 | `resultMessage` not in RDF | Low | Add `ot:resultMessage` to `turnResolvedQuads` |
| C6 | No game event entities in RDF | Medium | Create first-class `ot:GameEvent` entities per turn |
| C7 | No resource deltas in RDF | Low | Add structured resource snapshots per turn |

### 14.4 GossipSub

| # | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------|----------------|
| G1 | ~~`offMessage` has a bug~~ | ~~Bug~~ | **RESOLVED** — code is correct: `if (!handlers) return;` safely exits when no handlers exist, then deletes the specific handler and cleans up empty sets |
| G2 | All apps share single `app` topic per paranet | Medium | Add per-app subtopics: `dkg/paranet/{id}/app/{appId}` |
| G3 | No message signing/authentication on gossip level | Medium | GossipSub supports `strictNoSign: false` — enable message signing |
| G4 | Vote heartbeat creates O(n × 6) messages per turn | Low | Acceptable for 3-8 players; not scalable beyond ~20 |

### 14.5 Chain Integration

| # | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------|----------------|
| CH1 | Chain poller interval (12s) may miss events on fast L2s | Low | Use WebSocket subscription instead of polling where available |
| CH2 | No retry on failed chain tx (publish, mint) | Medium | Add exponential backoff retry for chain transactions |
| CH3 | Paranet metadata reveal is a separate tx | Low | Consider batching with creation tx to save gas |

### 14.6 Storage

| # | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------|----------------|
| S1 | Oxigraph doesn't support persistent WAL by default | Low | Ensure `oxigraph-persistent` backend is used in production |
| S2 | No compaction/garbage collection for dropped graphs | Low | Add periodic graph statistics and compaction |

### 14.7 Valuable Additions for Agents

Beyond fixing the gaps above, these additions to the knowledge graph would
significantly increase utility for AI agents:

1. **Consensus attestation triples** — Which specific nodes approved which turns,
   with their peerId and the proposal hash. Enables trust scoring and reputation.

2. **Publish provenance chain** — For each rootEntity, a provenance chain linking:
   `rootEntity → KA NFT → KC → txHash → blockNumber → publisher DID`.
   Currently requires 3 SPARQL joins; should be a direct property.

3. **Network topology hints** — Relay connections, direct connections, and peer
   latency metrics as RDF triples. Helps agents choose optimal peers.

4. **Workspace lineage** — Track which workspace entities were eventually
   enshrined (published) and link workspace operations to their resulting KCs.

5. **Game-specific: strategy patterns** — Aggregate voting patterns per player
   as RDF. Which players tend to vote "advance" vs "syncMemory"? This creates
   a behavioral knowledge graph that agents can use for strategy optimization.
