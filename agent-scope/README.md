# agent-scope

Task-scoped write permissions for AI coding agents.

An agent can **read** the whole repo, but can only **write** files that are
listed in the active task's manifest. Attempts to write out-of-scope files
are blocked by a stack of agent hooks (per-agent — Cursor, Claude Code) and
must be explicitly approved by a human (by editing the manifest). Agents
without a hook system (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, etc.) get the same rules
delivered as instruction files and self-enforce.

The guard restricts **agent** actions only. Humans committing, pushing, or
editing through their own terminal are never restricted — there are no git
hooks and no CI enforcement. If you edit a protected file by hand, you can
commit and push normally.

## Opt-in by default

agent-scope stays **invisible** until you engage it. With no active task and
no bootstrap, Cursor sessions behave as if the system didn't exist: the
session-start hook emits nothing, and the write/shell hooks only fire on the
hardcoded protected paths (the guard's own files). You can do ad-hoc work
without any task ceremony.

You engage the system in one of three ways:

1. **Guided onboarding** — run `pnpm task start`. The CLI prints a line you
   paste into your Cursor chat. The agent then asks you to describe the task,
   explores the codebase, proposes a scope via AskQuestion, and prints the
   exact `pnpm task create` command for you to run.
2. **Explicit** — `pnpm task set <existing-id>` activates a manifest you
   already have.
3. **Direct** — `pnpm task create <id> --description "..." --allowed "..." --activate`
   builds + activates a manifest in one shot.

Clearing the active task (`pnpm task clear`) returns Cursor to its invisible
default.

## Architecture (defense in depth)

```
Agent  → Cursor sessionStart hook       → injects active-task context + consumes any pending onboarding marker
Agent  → Cursor preToolUse hook         → blocks out-of-scope Write/Edit/Delete
Agent  → Cursor beforeShellExecution    → blocks destructive shell cmds on denied paths
Agent  → Cursor afterShellExecution     → reverts out-of-scope shell writes, deletes untracked files in denied paths
Agent  → Cursor postToolUse hook        → injects pending onboarding trigger in already-open chats (additive, never denies)
System → hardcoded protected paths      → always blocks agent writes to agent-scope itself
Ops    → optional webhook sink          → forwards denials to DKG/Slack/etc.
```

All four agent-facing layers use the same library
(`agent-scope/lib/scope.mjs`) and the same manifests
(`agent-scope/tasks/*.json`). The pre-shell and after-shell layers back each
other up, so destructive commands that slip past the pre-check get reverted
or deleted afterwards.

## Concepts

| Concept | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Task manifest** | `agent-scope/tasks/<id>.json` | Declares what files a task is allowed to modify |
| **JSON schema** | `agent-scope/schema/task.schema.json` | Validates manifest structure |
| **Active task** | `agent-scope/active` | One-line file with the active task id (gitignored, per-developer) |
| **Env override** | `AGENT_SCOPE_TASK` | If set, takes precedence over the file |
| **Branch convention** | `task/<id>/*` or `agent-scope/<id>/*` | Branch name auto-detects the task if the env/file is unset |
| **Git config fallback** | `git config agent-scope.task <id>` | Lowest-priority fallback |
| **Denial log** | `agent-scope/logs/denials.jsonl` | Append-only audit trail (gitignored, rotates at 5MB) |
| **Bootstrap token** | `agent-scope/.bootstrap-token` | If present, disables hardcoded path protection (for maintainers editing agent-scope itself) |
| **Bootstrap env** | `AGENT_SCOPE_BOOTSTRAP=1` | Same as above but per-process |
| **Webhook sink** | `AGENT_SCOPE_WEBHOOK=<url>` | POSTs each denial to the URL (opt-in) |

## Supported agents

| Agent | Enforcement | Wired via |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor | **hard hooks** — physical block | `.cursor/hooks/`, `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.cursor/rules/agent-scope.mdc` |
| Claude Code | **hard hooks** — physical block | `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md` |
| Codex CLI (OpenAI) | soft — agent self-enforces | `AGENTS.md` |
| Gemini CLI | soft — agent self-enforces | `GEMINI.md` |
| Continue / Cline / older Cursor | soft (varies) | `.cursorrules` |

**Hard enforcement** means the hook process physically rejects out-of-scope
writes before they hit disk, regardless of what the agent decides to do.
**Soft enforcement** means the agent reads the rule files at session start
and is expected to comply — this is the best we can do for agents that
don't expose a hook API yet.

The same task manifests, the same CLI (`pnpm task ...`), the same denial
menu structure apply across all agents — only the enforcement layer
differs.

## One-time setup

There is no setup. Each agent loads its own config files (`.cursor/...`,
`.claude/...`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) automatically when you open the repo.

After pulling the repo, run this once to verify your agent is wired up:

```bash
pnpm scope:check-agent       # or:  pnpm task check-agent
```

It prints a per-agent green/yellow/red status and tells you exactly what
(if anything) you need to do. Sample output:

```
Cursor                              [✓ active]
  enforcement: hard hooks
  ✓ .cursor/hooks.json present
  ✓ .cursor/hooks/scope-guard.mjs executable
  ...

Claude Code                         [✓ active]
  enforcement: hard hooks
  ✓ .claude/settings.json present
  ✓ .claude/hooks/scope-guard.mjs executable
  ...
  setup:
    First-run note: Claude Code will prompt you to TRUST the project hooks
    the first time you open this repo. Approve them — that's how
    enforcement attaches.

Codex CLI                           [~ soft]
  enforcement: soft (no hook system available)
  ✓ AGENTS.md present (Codex CLI reads this on every session)
  ! Hard blocks DO NOT apply here — Codex self-enforces.
```

Other sanity checks:

```bash
pnpm scope:test          # runs the scope library unit tests
pnpm scope:validate      # validates every manifest
```

### Per-agent setup notes

- **Cursor**: hooks load automatically from `.cursor/hooks.json` next time
  you open the repo. No prompt, no action needed.
- **Claude Code**: the first time you open this repo, Claude Code will
  prompt you to **trust the project hooks**. You must approve — that's how
  the enforcement attaches. After that it's automatic.
- **Codex CLI**: reads `AGENTS.md` automatically. No installation step.
  Caveat — Codex CLI has no hook API today, so blocking out-of-scope
  writes depends on the agent obeying the rules.
- **Gemini CLI**: reads `GEMINI.md` automatically. Same self-enforcement
  caveat as Codex.
- **Other agents** (Continue, Cline, Roo, older Cursor): pick up
  `.cursorrules`. Coverage varies — treat as best-effort.

## Quick start

```bash
# Guided onboarding — prints a chat trigger for the Cursor agent
pnpm task start

# Non-interactive manifest creation (run this yourself; see "Onboarding flow")
pnpm task create my-task \
  --description "Refactor peer sync for workspace auth" \
  --allowed "packages/agent/src/**sync*" \
  --allowed "packages/agent/test/**sync*" \
  --inherits base \
  --activate

# List available tasks (marks the active one with *)
pnpm task list

# Set the active task
pnpm task set sync-refactor

# See which task is active and what it allows
pnpm task show

# Debug how the active task was resolved (env/file/branch/git-config)
pnpm task resolve

# Create a new task manifest interactively (prompts you)
pnpm task init my-task

# Check whether a specific path is in scope
pnpm task check packages/agent/src/sync-handler.ts
# → allow

# Recent denials (audit)
pnpm task audit

# Clear the active task (writes unrestricted again)
pnpm task clear
```

## Onboarding flow

The `pnpm task start` command is the paved path. It does three things:

1. Drops a one-shot marker file at `agent-scope/.pending-onboarding`
   (gitignored).
2. Copies the onboarding trigger to your clipboard (best-effort, via
   `pbcopy` / `wl-copy` / `xclip` / `clip` depending on OS).
3. Prints a short message explaining the three equivalent paths to trigger
   the agent.

Any of these will start the onboarding — pick whichever is easiest:

- **New chat (Cmd+L / "new chat" button)** — the `sessionStart` hook
  detects the marker, injects the trigger as initial context, deletes the
  marker. The agent immediately asks you to describe the task.
- **Current chat, any message** — the next tool the agent calls triggers
  the `postToolUse` hook, which injects the trigger as
  `additional_context`. The agent sees it on the very next turn and
  pivots to onboarding.
- **Manual paste (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V)** — the trigger is already in your
  clipboard. Paste into any chat and send.

Whichever path fires, the agent then follows a fixed protocol (defined in
`.cursor/rules/agent-scope.mdc` and `CLAUDE.md`):

1. Asks you to describe what you're building or fixing.
2. Explores the codebase (Grep / Glob / DKG) to find relevant files.
3. Proposes a set of globs via `AskQuestion` in plan-mode style — approve,
   show JSON, edit, cancel, or type a custom instruction.
4. On approve, prints the exact `pnpm task create` command for you to run.
5. You run it in your terminal (not the agent — otherwise the
   `afterShellExecution` hook would delete the new manifest as an untracked
   file in a protected path).
6. The agent starts the real work.

From here, every attempted write to an out-of-scope file triggers a plan-mode
AskQuestion menu — see **Escalation** below.

The marker is one-shot: the first hook that consumes it also deletes it, so
the trigger fires exactly once per `pnpm task start`.

## Manifest format

```json
{
  "id": "sync-refactor",
  "description": "Refactor peer sync protocol to add workspace sync auth",
  "owner": "bojan",
  "allowed": [
    "packages/agent/src/**sync*",
    "packages/agent/src/discovery.ts",
    "packages/core/src/**sync*",
    "packages/publisher/src/**sync*",
    "packages/*/test/**sync*",
    "!**/secrets.*"
  ],
  "exemptions": [
    "**/dist/**",
    "**/*.tsbuildinfo",
    "pnpm-lock.yaml"
  ]
}
```

- `allowed` — glob patterns that the agent may write to. Supports `*`, `**`, `?`.
- `exemptions` — patterns that are always allowed (build artifacts, lockfiles).
- `!pattern` — explicit deny, overrides everything else in both lists.
- **Default-deny**: anything not matched is blocked.

Run `pnpm scope:validate` to verify all manifests conform to
`agent-scope/schema/task.schema.json`.

## How enforcement works

Four agent-facing layers, all running inside Cursor:

1. **`sessionStart` hook** (`.cursor/hooks/session-start.mjs`) injects the
   active task's allowed patterns into the agent's context so it knows what
   it may modify from the first turn. **When no task is active and bootstrap
   is off, the hook emits nothing** — the agent's initial context is
   untouched. Only when a task is active (or bootstrap is on) does it surface
   a context block.
2. **`preToolUse` hook** (`.cursor/hooks/scope-guard.mjs`) runs before every
   `Write`, `StrReplace`, `Delete`, `EditNotebook`, `MultiEdit`, and `Edit`.
   It runs the protected-path check first, then the task-scope check.
3. **`beforeShellExecution` hook** (`.cursor/hooks/shell-precheck.mjs`)
   tokenises the pending shell command and blocks destructive verbs
   (`rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `chmod`, `chown`, `truncate`, `ln -sf`, `sed -i`,
   redirections `>` / `>>` / `tee`, `find -delete`, `xargs rm`) when their
   target is out-of-scope or hardcode-protected. Recurses into `bash -c`,
   `sh -c`, and opaque evaluators (`node -e`, `python -c`, `perl -e`) to
   catch bypass attempts that hide destructive operations inside string
   arguments. Parsing logic lives in `agent-scope/lib/shell-parse.mjs` and
   is fully unit-tested.
4. **`afterShellExecution` hook** (`.cursor/hooks/shell-diff-check.mjs`) is
   the backstop for anything the pre-check misses: it runs
   `git status --porcelain`, `git checkout --` reverts any tracked
   out-of-scope/protected modifications, and **deletes** untracked files in
   denied paths (so an agent cannot establish persistent state like a new
   hook file via a pre-shell bypass).
5. **`postToolUse` hook** (`.cursor/hooks/post-tool-use.mjs`) exists only to
   consume a pending onboarding marker (written by `pnpm task start`) in an
   already-open chat. It never denies anything — it just injects the
   onboarding trigger as `additional_context` after the next tool call, so
   the agent pivots to the Task onboarding protocol on its next turn.

If no active task is set (no env, no file, no matching branch, no git-config)
**and** bootstrap is off, layer 1 is silent and layers 2–4 only trigger on
the hardcoded protected paths. Everything else is a no-op — you can do
ad-hoc work without changing the workflow. Layer 5 only emits anything when
`agent-scope/.pending-onboarding` is present.

No layer restricts **humans**. You can `git commit`, `git push`, and edit
anything manually through your terminal or IDE without interacting with the
guard — it only sees what the agent does.

## Hardcoded protected paths

Some files define the enforcement system itself. If the agent were free to
edit them, the whole thing would be worthless. These paths are **always
denied** regardless of active task, unless bootstrap mode is active:

- `.cursor/hooks/**`, `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.cursor/rules/agent-scope.mdc`
- `.claude/hooks/**`, `.claude/settings.json`
- `agent-scope/lib/**`, `agent-scope/bin/**`, `agent-scope/schema/**`
- `agent-scope/tasks/**`, `agent-scope/active`,
  `agent-scope/.bootstrap-token`
- `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`

(This list applies to **agent** writes only. A human editing any of these
files through their own terminal/IDE is not restricted.)

### Bootstrap mode

To legitimately improve `agent-scope` itself, a human enables bootstrap mode.
Two equivalent switches:

```bash
# Option A — file token (persists across sessions until deleted)
touch agent-scope/.bootstrap-token

# Option B — env var (just for the current Cursor process)
export AGENT_SCOPE_BOOTSTRAP=1
```

While bootstrap is active, the sessionStart hook prints a loud warning into
the agent context. When you're done, remove it:

```bash
rm agent-scope/.bootstrap-token
```

The bootstrap token is in `.gitignore`, so it cannot accidentally leak into
a commit even if you `git add .`. If you ever do `git add -f` it, remove it
before pushing.

## Manifest inheritance

Manifests can share common exemptions (e.g. `**/dist/**`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
via an `inherits` field. The `base` task ships as a pure-exemption parent:

```json
{ "id": "child", "inherits": ["base"], "allowed": ["src/**"] }
```

Inheritance merges parents first (deduplicating), then the child's own
`allowed`/`exemptions` are appended. `!pattern` denials in a child override
parent `allowed` patterns. Cycles are detected and rejected.

## Optional webhook sink

Forward denials to a DKG node / Slack / log aggregator by setting
`AGENT_SCOPE_WEBHOOK` to an http(s) URL. Each denial is POSTed as JSON
(fire-and-forget, 1.5s timeout). Activity is also written to
`agent-scope/logs/denials.jsonl` locally with automatic rotation at 5MB.

## Escalation — plan-mode denial menu

Every denial (preToolUse, beforeShellExecution, afterShellExecution) emits both
a human-readable prose block **and** a machine-readable JSON menu embedded in
the hook's response. Agents following `.cursor/rules/agent-scope.mdc` (and
`CLAUDE.md`) must parse the menu and surface it to the user via the same
`AskQuestion` mechanism Cursor uses for plan mode.

The structured block is fenced by HTML comments so it's trivial to locate:

```
<!-- agent-scope-menu:begin -->
{
  "version": 1,
  "hook": "preToolUse",
  "reason": "out-of-scope",
  "deniedPath": "packages/evm-module/contracts/Staking.sol",
  "activeTask": "sync-refactor",
  "suggestedGlob": "packages/evm-module/contracts/**",
  "alternativeTasks": [ { "id": "staking", "description": "..." } ],
  "options": [
    { "id": "add_file",           "label": "...", "action": { "kind": "add_to_manifest", ... } },
    { "id": "add_glob",           "label": "...", "action": { "kind": "add_to_manifest", ... } },
    { "id": "switch_task_staking","label": "...", "action": { "kind": "switch_task",     "task": "staking" } },
    { "id": "skip",               "label": "...", "action": { "kind": "skip" } },
    { "id": "cancel",             "label": "...", "action": { "kind": "cancel" } },
    { "id": "custom_instruction", "label": "Let me type my own instruction", "action": { "kind": "custom" } }
  ],
  "recommendedOptionId": "add_glob",
  "agentReasoning": null
}
<!-- agent-scope-menu:end -->
```

Possible `action.kind` values:

| kind | what the agent should do |
|---|---|
| `add_to_manifest` | Add `action.patterns` to `agent-scope/tasks/<action.task>.json` under `allowed`, then retry the original operation. |
| `switch_task` | Run `pnpm task set <action.task>`, then retry. |
| `bootstrap` | Print `action.instruction` to the user and wait for confirmation. Remind them to remove the token after. |
| `fix_manifest` | Open `agent-scope/tasks/<action.task>.json`, fix the error (`action.error`), re-run `pnpm task validate`. |
| `clear_task` | Run `pnpm task clear`. |
| `skip` | Acknowledge and move on. |
| `cancel` | Stop the turn; summarise for the user. |
| `custom` | Ask the user in plain chat what they want instead, then do it. |

Extra guidance in the block:

- `recommendedOptionId` is a hint for which option to highlight. It's chosen
  conservatively (`add_glob` for out-of-scope, `cancel` for protected,
  `fix_manifest` for manifest-load errors). The agent is told to lead with it
  unless overriding has a concrete reason.
- `agentReasoning: null` is a placeholder. The hook can't know the agent's
  reasoning, so the agent **fills it in when surfacing the menu via
  `AskQuestion`**: the prompt must include a 1–2 sentence "here's what I was
  trying to do and why this file came up". Plan-mode equivalent.

Heuristics (in `agent-scope/lib/denial.mjs`):

- `suggestedGlob` is derived from the denied path's parent directory
  (`dirname/**`).
- `alternativeTasks` lists up to 3 other manifests that already cover the
  denied path.
- `protected` reasons offer only `bootstrap` / `skip` / `cancel` /
  `custom_instruction` — no other option can legitimately unblock the write.

Builders and tests live alongside the scope library:

```
agent-scope/lib/denial.mjs         # the builders
agent-scope/lib/denial.test.mjs    # 33 unit tests
```

No special tokens or APIs — the manifest is the source of truth; edit it to
grant permission. Changes to a manifest still go through normal review.

## Debug / audit

```bash
pnpm task resolve        # how was the active task resolved?
pnpm task audit          # recent denials
pnpm task validate       # check all manifests
tail -f agent-scope/logs/denials.jsonl
```
