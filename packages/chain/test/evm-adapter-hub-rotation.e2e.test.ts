/**
 * EVMChainAdapter — Hub rotation self-refresh (E2E against Hardhat).
 *
 * This file exercises the structural fix for the post-rotation
 * stale-address bug that bricked `RandomSampling` writes from running
 * daemons whenever the Hub rotated to a new RS deployment. The fix
 * lives in `evm-adapter.ts` (`HubResolutionCache` for RS+RSS, plus a
 * Hub event listener and a `withHubStaleRetry` wrapper); the unit
 * tests in `hub-resolution-cache.unit.test.ts` cover the cache
 * primitive in isolation. Here we drive a **real** Hardhat node with
 * a **real** `Hub.setContractAddress(...)` rotation and assert the
 * adapter picks up the new address through each of the three refresh
 * paths without restart:
 *
 *   1. TTL refresh    — cached address is replaced after `ttlMs` elapses
 *                       and the next adapter call re-resolves from Hub.
 *   2. Event listener — adapter's `Hub.ContractChanged`/`NewContract`
 *                       subscription invalidates the cache as soon as
 *                       the rotation is mined.
 *   3. Self-heal      — `withHubStaleRetry()` catches the exact revert
 *                       wording the prover sees in the wild
 *                       (`UnauthorizedAccess(Only Contracts in Hub)`),
 *                       drops the cache, and retries the call once.
 *
 * Plus two negative / belt-and-braces cases:
 *
 *   4. Errors that don't match the marker are NOT treated as stale —
 *      cache stays intact and the wrapper does not retry.
 *   5. Full happy path: after rotating away and back, a real public
 *      adapter read (`getActiveProofPeriodStatus`) succeeds against
 *      the freshly resolved contract — the visible "no daemon restart
 *      needed" property the PR is shipping.
