// Codex Bug B24: the `DkgMemoryPlugin` class no longer exposes the legacy
// `OpenClawMemorySearchManager` surface (see the breaking-change JSDoc on
// the class). Both explicit tool surfaces that previously shipped alongside
// it — `dkg_memory_import` (writes) and the `dkg_memory_search` legacy-
// gateway compat tool — have also been retired; reads and writes flow
// through the memory slot via `api.registerMemoryCapability`. Programmatic
// search remains available to external consumers via `DkgMemorySearchManager`
// (the standalone search implementation that used to be backed by methods
// on `DkgMemoryPlugin`) and `buildDkgMemoryRuntime` (the factory used with
// `api.registerMemoryCapability`), along with the resolver interface they
// depend on. Re-export them from the barrel so the migration path documented
// on `DkgMemoryPlugin` is actually reachable from
// `@origintrail-official/dkg-adapter-openclaw`.
