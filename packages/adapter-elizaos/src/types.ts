 * Minimal subset of the ElizaOS `Memory` message surface that the DKG

 * content }` are optional because the upstream ElizaOS type doesn't
 * model them, but the DKG chat-persistence code *does* read them:
 *
 *   - `id`         → stable turn source id (required by
 *                    `persistChatTurnImpl` in the user-turn path; the
 *                    function throws loudly if missing so the caller
 *                    boundary surfaces the violation instead of
 *                    silently fabricating a time-based id).
 *   - `createdAt`  → preferred source for `schema:dateCreated` so
 *                    retries produce byte-identical quads.
 *   - `timestamp`, `date`, `ts` → legacy aliases accepted for the
 *                    same purpose (matches adapter callers in the
 *                    wild — we normalise via `coerceToIsoDateTime`).
 *   - `inReplyTo`  → link from an assistant reply back to its user
 *                    turn so downstream consumers can reconstruct
 *                    threading even without running through the chat
 *                    memory reader.
 *
 * Exposing these on the PUBLIC adapter type means downstream
 * TypeScript consumers can't satisfy `Memory` and still
 * deterministically throw at runtime — the contract is enforced
 * at compile time.

 *
 * Assistant-reply paths don't need this — they derive the turn key
 * from `ChatTurnPersistOptions.userMessageId` instead — so the
 * plain `Memory` type stays as-is for those callers.

 *   // assistant-reply options — callers that don't know whether

 *   // to route through the safe full-envelope branch.
