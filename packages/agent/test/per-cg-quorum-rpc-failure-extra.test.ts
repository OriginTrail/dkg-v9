/**
 * Anti-drift structural guards for the per-CG `requiredSignatures`
 * resolution path in `dkg-agent.ts`.
 *
 * An earlier implementation wrapped BOTH the `BigInt(onChainId)`
 * parse AND the chain-RPC call to `getContextGraphRequiredSignatures()`
 * in a single catch block:
 *
 *   try {
 *     const id = BigInt(onChainId);
 *     if (id > 0n) {
 *       const n = await this.chain.getContextGraphRequiredSignatures(id);
 *       if (Number.isFinite(n) && n > 0) perCgRequiredSignatures = n;
 *     }
 *   } catch {
 *     // non-numeric on-chain id (mock-only graph) → skip per-CG gate.
 *   }
 *
 * The catch block was supposed to swallow the legitimate "mock-only
 * graph has a non-numeric id" case (the BigInt parse throws a
 * `SyntaxError`). But because the await on the RPC call lived inside
 * the same try, ANY transient chain-RPC failure (provider timeout,
 * contract revert, RPC node 502) was also swallowed silently — and
 * `perCgRequiredSignatures` quietly stayed `undefined`. The publish
 * path then fell back to the global
 * `ParametersStorage.minimumRequiredSignatures` and could confirm
 * an M-of-N context graph with too few ACKs.
 *
 * The current implementation splits the two failure modes:
 *   (a) BigInt parse failure → mock-only on-chain id, skip the gate;
 *   (b) RPC / contract failure → propagate so the publish fails
 *       loudly instead of silently downgrading the quorum.
 *
 * These tests pin the contract structurally so a future "tidy the
 * catch back together" change reintroduces the regression visibly:
 *   1. Source-level: `dkg-agent.ts` must NOT contain a try/catch
 *      that wraps both the `BigInt(onChainId)` parse AND the
 *      `await this.chain.getContextGraphRequiredSignatures(...)`
 *      RPC call.
 *   2. Source-level: the RPC call MUST live OUTSIDE the catch
 *      block, so RPC errors propagate to the caller.
 *   3. Both call sites (the `_publish()` direct path AND the
 *      `publishFromSharedMemory()` SWM path) get the same treatment.
 *
 * No chain spin-up is needed — these are structural anti-drift
 * guards that read the source file directly. Behavioural coverage
 * for the per-CG quorum gate itself lives in
 * `per-cg-quorum-extra.test.ts` (real chain, real publisher) and
 * is the source of truth for the "tentative vs confirmed" outcome.
