/**
 * chain-event-poller-r24-4.test.ts
 *
 * `ChainEventPoller.poll()` used
 * to short-circuit on:
 *
 *   if (!hasPending && !watchContextGraphs && !watchUpdates
 *       && !watchAllowList && !watchProfiles) return;
 *
 * A poller configured ONLY for WAL recovery — i.e. wired with
 * `onUnmatchedBatchCreated` (which is the handler we installed in
 * r21-5 / r23-3 to drain the WAL after a restart) but with no
 * pending publishes and no other watchers — would therefore NEVER
 * scan `KnowledgeBatchCreated` / `KCCreated`. The WAL entry it was
 * supposed to reconcile against the chain event would sit there
 * forever, violating the P-1 durability contract.
 *
 * This file uses a captive mock ChainAdapter so we can deterministically
 * assert:
 *   1. `listenForEvents` IS invoked on every tick when only
 *      `onUnmatchedBatchCreated` is wired — even with no pending
 *      publishes. (The regression.)
 *   2. A poller wired for NEITHER pending publishes NOR any watcher
 *      still short-circuits (no spurious RPC traffic).
 *
 * NO blockchain. This is a unit-level pin on the early-return gate
 * because exercising the same regression against Hardhat would
 * require orchestrating a full restart + WAL + real KnowledgeBatch
 * event, which the existing `publish-lifecycle.test.ts` and
 * `wal-recovery.test.ts` already cover at integration scope.
