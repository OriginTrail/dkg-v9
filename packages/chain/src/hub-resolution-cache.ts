/**
 * Caches a Hub-resolved value (typically a `Contract` instance for a
 * given Hub-registered contract name). Re-resolves lazily when:
 *   - cache is empty (first call),
 *   - TTL expired (when `ttlMs > 0`), OR
 *   - `invalidate()` was called explicitly (e.g. from a Hub
 *     `ContractChanged` / `NewContract` event listener, or after a
 *     write surfaced `UnauthorizedAccess(Only Contracts in Hub)`).
 *
 * This is the structural fix for the post-rotation stale-address bug:
 * `EVMChainAdapter` cached every Hub-resolved address once at boot, so
 * a contract rotation on the live Hub (e.g. `RandomSampling` swapped
 * to a new deployment) silently broke writes from running daemons —
 * the OLD address kept getting called, was no longer "in Hub", and
 * its writes to its storage contract reverted with
 * `UnauthorizedAccess(Only Contracts in Hub)` until the daemon was
 * restarted.
 *
 * The cache is intentionally agnostic to what `T` is: callers wire it
 * up with a resolver closure that does the actual `Hub.getContractAddress`
 * + `new Contract(...)` step.
