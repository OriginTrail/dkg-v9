# V10 Test Audit — Bugs & Findings

Branch: `tests/improve` (off `v10-rc`)
Started: 2026-04-20
Method: spec-first audit using parallel deep-dive subagents per TORNADO package, cross-referenced against ~80 open GitHub issues. Baseline `v10-rc` CI is green; baseline `core` suite passes 442/442.

Out of scope: `node-ui`, `graph-viz`, `origin-trail-game` (UI/demo tier).

---

## Legend

- **NEW** — not previously reported in GitHub issues
- **DUP #N** — already filed
- **SPEC-GAP** — spec requirement has no test
- **HIDES-BUG** — mock/swallow that could mask a real bug
- **WRONG-EXPECT** — test asserts wrong/spec-violating behavior
- **TEST-DEBT** — test is misnamed, weak, or skipped
- **PROD-BUG** — issue in production code, not just tests

---

## Audit results

### packages/core (TORNADO) — 27 test files, 442 tests pass

**Mocks:** none (`vi.mock`/`vi.spyOn`/`vi.fn` are absent except `vi.useFakeTimers` in rate-limiter and manual stdout patches in logger). Strong baseline.

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-1 | **CRITICAL** | **PROD-BUG / NEW** | **`computeUpdateACKDigest` allocates a 340-byte packed buffer but only writes 308 bytes** (10 fields totalling 32+20+32+32+32+32+32+32+32+32 = 308). The trailing 32 zero bytes ARE included in `keccak256`, so the off-chain digest does NOT match the on-chain digest computed by `KnowledgeAssetsV10.sol` lines 832-846. **Every V10 UPDATE signed off-chain will fail `_verifySignatures` on chain.** Confirmed by side-by-side comparison vs `ethers.solidityPackedKeccak256`. The function's own docstring says "total packed width = 340 bytes" — also wrong. Test `v10-ack-digests-extra.test.ts > matches the contract-layout golden vector` is red and stays red until the buffer is sized correctly to 308. **This was undetectable before this audit because the function had zero tests.** |
| C-2 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | 6-field `computeACKDigest(cgId, root, kaCount, byteSize, epochs, tokenAmount)` is implemented in `ack.ts` but tests only call the 2-field form. Replay across cost parameters is undetectable. |
| C-3 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | `eip191Hash` lacks a golden vector cross-checked against `ethers.signMessage` / `verifyMessage`. Off-by-one in the `\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32` prefix would still pass current tests. |
| C-4 | High | WRONG-EXPECT / NEW | `oracle-verify.test.ts` builds proofs with **SHA-256 `MerkleTree` + `hashTriple`** while PUBLISH uses **keccak `V10MerkleTree` + `hashTripleV10`** on chain. If oracle proofs need to match VM Merkle, this is a primitive mismatch that won't fire until interop testing. |
| C-5 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | `canonicalize.ts` comment says RDFC-1.0; spec / TORNADO checklist says URDNA2015. No test pins the algorithm ID — silent migration is possible. |
| C-6 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | `computeGossipSigningPayload` test uses literal `'tc1'` as the prefix. Real prefix is `type+contextGraphId+timestamp` — the test cannot catch length-prefix or concatenation bugs. |
| C-7 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | `v10-proto.test.ts` `VerifyProposal` round-trip omits `verifiedMemoryId` and `batchId`; `StorageACK` first test omits `nodeIdentityId`. Proto field reorder/wrong-tag regressions can hide. |
| C-8 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / DUP #173 | `escapeSparqlLiteral` doesn't handle lone surrogates (U+D800–U+DFFF). Test does not cover this; matches existing issue #173. |
| C-9 | High | PROD-BUG / NEW | `ProtocolRouter` does not verify signatures on incoming streams. Any peer that completes libp2p handshake can hit handlers. Tests mirror this (echo only). If spec requires signed streams, this is an architectural gap. |
| C-10 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | `proto-finalization-edge.test.ts` documents that protobufjs decodes truncated buffers without throwing — but no integration test fails closed at the caller layer. Risk: half-empty structs treated as valid. |
| C-11 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | `memory-model.ts` `TransitionType` enum only has `CREATE`/`UPDATE`. Spec axiom 3 lists SHARE/PUBLISH/VERIFY/DISCARD as transitions. Tests freeze the narrower model without reconciling. |
| C-12 | Low | TEST-DEBT | V10 Merkle "golden vector" test only asserts non-zero, not a fixed hex root. Snapshot regressions invisible. |
| C-13 | Low | SPEC-GAP | `hashTripleV10` lacks tests for typed literal with language tag vs plain (`"foo"@en` vs `"foo"`) and same-lexical-different-datatype distinction. |
| C-14 | Low | SPEC-GAP | `auth.token` file format `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{43}` not enforced by test in `dkg-home.test.ts`. File mode/permissions also untested. |

### packages/publisher (TORNADO) — 46 test files

**Mocks:** none in main spec sense; some narrow `vi.spyOn` for chain adapter recording. Some swallowed-error patterns flagged below.

#### Spec model mismatch (read this first)

The publication 4-state machine per spec §06 (`queued | processing | finalized | failed`) is **not** what the codebase implements — `lift-job-states.ts` uses 7 states (`accepted → claimed → validated → broadcast → included → finalized | failed`). Tests cover the 7-state lift job thoroughly but not the 4-state spec model. This is either a doc-vs-code inconsistency or a hidden architectural drift.

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| P-1 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **Write-ahead `txHash` is never asserted.** Spec §6 requires persisting txHash to the control plane *before* `eth_sendRawTransaction`. No test enforces order — regression to "broadcast without durable hash" stays green. |
| P-2 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **Fencing token is completely untested.** Health-check reset spawning a stale worker → double-broadcast scenario is uncovered. |
| P-3 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **ACK replay across cost params is not tested.** Spec binds `(cgId, root, kaCount, byteSize, epochs, tokenAmount)`. No test signs one tuple and submits with a different `tokenAmount`/`epochs`/etc. Core economic safety. |
| P-4 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **512 KB SHARE auto-batch boundary has zero tests.** Constant exists in `dkg-publisher.ts` but no boundary test (512 KB-1 vs 512 KB+1). |
| P-5 | High | WRONG-EXPECT / NEW | `signature-collection.test.ts` still uses **legacy 2-field ACK digests** instead of V10 6-field. Can drift silently from on-chain contract while staying green. |
| P-6 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **SWM-before-chain ordering not enforced** by tests. Phase callbacks tested, but no spy/assert that chain RPC cannot fire before SWM materialization. Axiom 4 / §06 design principle. |
| P-7 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **Sync-mode wallet claim** untested. No test proves sync publish acquires the same wallet lease as async (nonce-conflict shortcut would pass). |
| P-8 | High | SPEC-GAP | **VERIFY M-of-N semantics under-tested.** `verify-collector.test.ts` checks peer count but not "single voter does NOT promote trust level". |
| P-9 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`storage-ack-handler.test.ts` missing core-node allowlist negative test** ("rejects signing when node operational key is not in core ACK roster"). |
| P-10 | Medium | HIDES-BUG / NEW | `v10-remap-wire.test.ts:195` — `collector.collect(...).catch(() => {})`. Errors discarded; only follow-up assertions on `dispatchedIntent` run. |
| P-11 | Medium | HIDES-BUG / NEW | `dkg-publisher.test.ts` — two `try { await publisher.assertionWrite(...) } catch {}` blocks documented as "tolerating duplicate"; in practice swallows ANY failure. |
| P-12 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | `lift-job-failure.test.ts` lacks `ack_collection` phase in `LIFT_JOB_FAILURE_PHASES` — spec §6 §8 lists it. |
| P-13 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | `get-views.test.ts` covers view URI resolution only — **no `minTrust` filtering** test (spec §12 Context Oracle). |
| P-14 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | `e2e-publisher-queue.test.ts` recovery scenarios use mocks for `chainRecoveryResolver` — pending tx, replaced tx, reorg matrix not actually exercised. |
| P-15 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **Internal `publishFromSharedMemory` bypass** documented in `dkg-publisher.test.ts` — tests confirm internal callers can skip some guards external `publish()` enforces. Architectural smell with no spec acceptance test. |
| P-16 | Low | SPEC-GAP | No regression test referencing issue **#151** (queue stuck `accepted`) by name. |
| P-17 | Low | SPEC-GAP | No regression test referencing issue **#150** (UPDATE BatchNotFound) by name. |
| P-18 | Low | SPEC-GAP | No `lookupByUAL` test in publisher (issue **#79** lives in another package). |
| P-19 | Low | SPEC-GAP | `finalization` tests assert merkle root match but no test for `kcMerkleRoot` mismatch with chain anchor → no promotion. |

### packages/agent (TORNADO) — 28 test files

**Mocks in `agent.test.ts`:** all `vi.spyOn` calls audited. **None classified as "hides-bug"** in isolation. They test orchestration counters (peer ordering, sync deadlines, metaSynced flag) and have e2e backstops in `e2e-workspace-sync`, `e2e-bulletproof`, `e2e-publish-protocol`, `e2e-privacy`. Only weak spot: preferred-peer ordering has no dedicated e2e.

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| A-1 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No multi-agent-per-node WM isolation test.** Spec axiom: agents on the same node must be unable to read each other's WM. Existing isolation tests are node-vs-node or separate `dataDir`, not two agents on one node. |
| A-2 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No SHARE 512 KB auto-batch boundary test in agent layer.** (Same finding as P-4 from a different angle.) |
| A-3 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No SWM first-writer-wins / soft-lock test.** Constant `SWM_ENTITY_OWNED` does not appear in any test. No two-writer race on same entity URI. |
| A-4 | Critical | WRONG-EXPECT / NEW | **`finalization-handler.test.ts` "merkle matches" test is misnamed AND doesn't promote.** The test named *"promotes workspace data to canonical when merkle matches"* asserts `ASK { ... } === false` (no canonical data). Both match and mismatch end up not promoting in this unit setup. Either test bug or genuine implementation gap. |
| A-5 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`e2e-publish-protocol.test.ts` documents** that publish can succeed with global `minimumRequiredSignatures` even when per-CG quorum is 2. This contradicts spec §10 M-of-N, related to issue **#4** (consensus hardcoded). Needs a spec-aligned test that fails. |
| A-6 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No private-CG SWM ciphertext round-trip test.** Tests have ECDH primitives but no end-to-end "share to private CG → intercept stored form → confirm ciphertext → decrypt with epoch key → wrong key fails". |
| A-7 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **ENDORSE has no signature or replay tests.** `endorse.test.ts` only validates quad shape from `buildEndorsementQuads`. |
| A-8 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **Key rotation pending-rotation state with TTL is completely untested.** Spec §18 mandates this. |
| A-9 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **Storage-ACK transport `/dkg/10.0.0/storage-ack` not distinguished from GossipSub.** No test spies on libp2p dial to verify the right protocol ID is used for ACK collection. |
| A-10 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **ACK 6-field digest + EIP-191 signing not tested in agent layer** (only loose comments + private-sync signing which uses a different protocol). |
| A-11 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **Publisher conviction NFT registration is a chain tx** — no test in agent layer verifies it. |
| A-12 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | **Agent identity story drifts** — tests mix `did:dkg:agent:Qm...` (peer ID) and `did:dkg:agent:0x...` (Ethereum addr). Spec mandates the address form. |
| A-13 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **`.dkg/config.yaml` workspace config** (spec doc 22) has no test in agent layer. |
| A-14 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | `e2e-bulletproof.test.ts` contains long comment blocks that *document* gaps (sync, WM) but do not enforce them — the build won't fail if they regress. |
| A-15 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No test that "publisher signs every gossip message"** end-to-end. `gossip-validation.test.ts` is partial (tentative metadata, txHash); no full positive/negative matrix on signing or CG-membership validation. |

### packages/evm-module (TORNADO) — 36 Hardhat test files + 9 helpers

**Coverage gates:** `scripts/check-evm-coverage.mjs` enforces lines ≥ 60%, branches ≥ 48%, functions ≥ 65%. TORNADO target is 95/90/95. CI can pass while large branches stay unexercised.

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-1 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`Hub.setAndReinitializeContracts` is untested.** This is the function that does the atomic V10 mainnet contract swap on launch day per `V10_MAINNET_LAUNCH_PLAN.md`. No test for partial-failure bubbling, atomic rollback, or non-owner revert. |
| E-2 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`DKGStakingConvictionNFT.unstake` has zero tests.** `LockNotExpired`, `InsufficientStake`, partial withdraw vs full burn, non-owner unstake — none covered. |
| E-3 | Critical | TEST-DEBT / DUP #4 | **RandomSampling multisig-as-hub-owner tests are commented out** (`test/unit/RandomSampling.test.ts:332,397` and `RandomSamplingStorage.test.ts:189,213`). Documents a real config gap that's not fixed. Affects consensus parameters. |
| E-4 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No test for ACK signed-vs-submitted cost-param mismatch.** Sign with one `tokenAmount`, submit with a different one — should revert. Critical economic safety. |
| E-5 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **H5 contract-address binding has no negative test.** Chain ID is covered (T1.6), wrong field order is covered (T1.5), but "ACK signed with a different `KnowledgeAssetsV10` address" is uncovered (replay across redeployed KAV10). |
| E-6 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`AccountExpired` revert path on `DKGPublishingConvictionNFT` is not tested.** Spec §07 specifies it; no `topUp` after expiry, no `coverPublishingCost` after expiry. |
| E-7 | High | PROD-BUG / NEW | **`Hub._setContractAddress` emits `NewContract` twice.** `contracts/storage/Hub.sol` lines ~189 and ~204 in the update branch. Indexers will double-count. |
| E-8 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`minimumRequiredSignatures` dynamism is untested.** `KnowledgeAssetsV10` reads it from `ParametersStorage`; raising quorum above signature count should revert "Insufficient unique receiver identities". No test for that path. |
| E-9 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **KAV10 publish event matrix incomplete.** No test asserts the full set of `KnowledgeCollectionCreated` / `KnowledgeCollectionUpdated` events from `KnowledgeCollectionStorage`. Spec lists dual emit `KnowledgeBatchCreated + KnowledgeCollectionCreated` — code path differs from spec. |
| E-10 | High | SPEC-DRIFT / NEW | **`addBatchToContextGraph` removed from contracts but still in spec §3.3.** `ContextGraphs.test.ts` documents the removal; spec is stale. |
| E-11 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **`MigratorV10Staking` does not exist in the repo.** Spec mentions zero-token migration of V8 delegator state. Only `Migrator`, `MigratorV6*`, `MigratorV8*` exist. |
| E-12 | Medium | TEST-DEBT / DUP #4 | **Staking integration test has TODO** (`Staking.test.ts:858`) about manual reward calculation across proof periods — masks potential double-count/underpay bugs. |
| E-13 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | **Paranet pool funding** (`Paranet.test.ts:1183`) TODO — pool/reward economic surface under-tested. |
| E-14 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | **`v10-conviction.test.ts` is shallow on Flow 1/2** (no lock tiers via staking NFT, no unstake). Only Flow 3 is strong. |
| E-15 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | **Helpers (`v10-kc-helpers.ts` etc.) mirror contract behavior but are not tested themselves.** Parallel bug in helper + contract → false positive. |
| E-16 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | **`DKGStakingConvictionNFT` test uses an EOA as `StakingStorage`** in fixtures. Real flow delegates to `Staking`. Integration failures hidden. |
| E-17 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **`Profile.registerNode` 50K TRAC core-stake rule** not asserted at the Profile layer; integration tests use the value but don't pin the contract enforcement. |
| E-18 | Low | SPEC-DRIFT | **Paymaster ≠ ERC-2771.** Spec checklist mentions "any wallet submits signed agent op"; current Paymaster is allowlisted `coverCost`. Either spec or code is wrong. |
| E-19 | Low | TEST-DEBT | **TORNADO coverage thresholds are 60/48/65** — far below 95/90/95. Will need ratcheting up. |
| E-20 | High | **PROD-BUG / NEW** | **`_isMultiSigOwner` (in `RandomSampling.sol`, `RandomSamplingStorage.sol`, `Hub.sol`, `ParametersStorage.sol`, all Migrator contracts, etc.) is not EOA-safe.** When the Hub owner is an EOA (which is the live dev/test config, and plausibly a transitional mainnet state), the compiler-inserted `extcodesize(hubOwner) > 0` guard reverts BEFORE the try-wrapped external call in `try ICustodian(addr).getOwners()` and the empty revert data (`0x`) bubbles past the `catch` clause, preempting the intended `revert HubLib.UnauthorizedAccess("Only Hub Owner or Multisig Owner")`. Observed on solc 0.8.20: unauthorized callers still revert, but with **empty revert data** instead of the typed `UnauthorizedAccess` selector, which (a) breaks indexers that route on the error, (b) masks misconfig vs bypass vs OOG, and (c) caused E-3 tests to fail with `reverted without a reason` rather than the declared custom error. Surfaced by `packages/evm-module/test/unit/v10-random-sampling-multisig-audit.test.ts` (tests intentionally left RED). Fix: short-circuit with `if (multiSigAddress.code.length == 0) return false;` before the external call. |

## Summary by severity (all packages)

| Severity | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | 14 | Hub atomic swap untested, fencing token untested, write-ahead txHash untested, multi-agent WM isolation untested, SWM first-writer-wins untested, finalization-handler test misnamed, RandomSampling multisig disabled, unstake untested, ACK replay across cost params, **chain default vitest config skips integration**, **PrivateContentStore not encrypted (vs README)**, **publishToContextGraph chains two txs**, **adapter-parity is a mock**, **named-graph isolation untested** |
| High | 45 | Spec-mandated tests missing across all TORNADO + BURA packages, `Hub._setContractAddress` double-emit, `Q-1` `_minTrust` not enforced, RPC failure matrix absent, no ABI pinning, no signed-request auth tests |
| Medium | 41 | Spec-vs-code drift, weak assertions, TODO/skipped tests, mock-heavy adapter coverage |
| Low | 11 | Coverage gates, naming inconsistencies, stale spec, view helpers untested |

**Production bugs found (not test bugs):**
0. **CRITICAL** — **`origin-trail-game` coordinator calls a non-existent agent API shape** (G-1) → every on-chain expedition launch silently falls back to no context graph → every multi-turn game e2e fails at `status === 'traveling'`. `createContextGraph` returns void; game expects `{success, contextGraphId}` — should call `registerContextGraphOnChain` instead.
1. **CRITICAL** — **`computeUpdateACKDigest` allocates 340 bytes but writes 308** (C-1) → off-chain UPDATE digest never matches on-chain digest → **every V10 UPDATE signature will fail `_verifySignatures` on chain**. Confirmed by ethers cross-check.
2. `Hub._setContractAddress` emits `NewContract` event twice (E-7)
3. `ProtocolRouter` has no signature verification on streams (C-9, architectural)
4. `finalization-handler.test.ts` test name vs assertion suggests promotion-on-merkle-match may not work in unit context (A-4) — needs verification
5. `canonicalize.ts` uses RDFC-1.0 but spec checklist says URDNA2015 (C-5, ambiguous)
6. `DKGPublishingConvictionNFT` likely missing `AccountExpired` enforcement on `topUp` / `coverPublishingCost` (E-6, needs verification)
7. `dkg-publisher` `publishFromSharedMemory` internal path bypasses guards (P-15, architectural)
8. **`PrivateContentStore` is not encrypted** despite README "encrypted" claim (ST-2) — quads stored as plaintext in `_private` graph
9. **`publishToContextGraph` always chains two transactions** (V9 paranet + V10 createKnowledgeAssetsV10) returning only the second result (CH-2)
10. **`QueryOptions._minTrust` is declared but unused** in `DKGQueryEngine` (Q-1) — trust filter is decorative
11. **`packages/chain/vitest.config.ts` excludes** `evm-adapter.test.ts` + `evm-e2e.test.ts` from default run (CH-1) — most lifecycle coverage skipped unless CI runs alternate target

**Spec drift (spec needs updating to match code, or vice versa):**
1. Publication 4-state machine vs lift-job 7-state (P spec model mismatch)
2. `addBatchToContextGraph` removed from code, still in spec §3.3 (E-10)
3. Paymaster mechanism (E-18)
4. `MigratorV10Staking` missing (E-11)

## Already-known bugs cross-referenced (do NOT re-file)

These open issues are touched by the audit and should be linked when fixing related tests:
- #2, #4, #9, #10, #11, #23, #31, #32, #34, #41 (foundational)
- #71, #72, #76, #77, #78, #79, #80, #81, #82, #83 (CLI/HTTP layer)
- #85, #86, #87, #88, #89 (CLI/HTTP edge cases)
- #150, #151, #158, #159, #163 (devnet / publisher / chain)
- #173 (sparql-safe surrogates — directly referenced by C-8)

The audit explicitly cross-referenced and confirmed:
- **#173 has no test** — finding C-8 confirms
- **#4 surfaces in `e2e-publish-protocol.test.ts`** as documented (in)consistency between global vs per-CG quorum — finding A-5
- **#150, #151, #79, #163, #159, #158, #10, #31, #32** have no regression tests in publisher — findings P-16/17/18

### packages/chain (TORNADO) — 8 test files

**Critical config note:** `vitest.config.ts` **excludes** `evm-adapter.test.ts` and `evm-e2e.test.ts` from the default run. The bulk of `EVMChainAdapter` lifecycle coverage (publish/update/event-listening/createKnowledgeAssetsV10/createOnChainContextGraph) is therefore not executed by `pnpm test` in this package unless an alternate target is wired in CI. **This is the single most impactful finding** — most findings below assume the excluded files do run.

**Mocks:** none in unit-only files; integration/e2e files use real Hardhat. `MockChainAdapter` exists in `src/` but has zero tests.

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| CH-1 | Critical | TEST-DEBT / NEW | **Default vitest run skips `evm-adapter.test.ts` + `evm-e2e.test.ts`.** Lifecycle coverage absent unless CI runs the integration target. Easy regression vector. |
| CH-2 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`publishToContextGraph`** is implemented (sends V9 paranet tx, then ALWAYS chains `createKnowledgeAssetsV10` and returns its result). Untested. Architectural smell — two transactions, one return. |
| CH-3 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`updateKnowledgeCollectionV10`, `verifyKAUpdate`, `resolvePublishByTxHash`** untested. Core UPDATE/GET-on-chain paths. |
| CH-4 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No RPC failure matrix.** No tests for: timeout, replaced tx, reorg, dropped from mempool, nonce too low/high, gas underpriced. Production-realistic failure modes uncovered. |
| CH-5 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No ABI hash pinning.** Contract changes without ABI regen wouldn't be caught. `loadAbi` reads packaged JSON — no test asserts it matches `@origintrail-official/dkg-evm-module` digest. |
| CH-6 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No raw-log topic vs decoded-struct test** for `ContextGraphCreated`, `KnowledgeCollectionCreated`, `KnowledgeAssetsMinted`. #32 class regression. |
| CH-7 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`coverPublishingCost`** flow not exposed on `EVMChainAdapter`; spec "pay from conviction account" untestable at adapter boundary. |
| CH-8 | High | TEST-DEBT / NEW | **`MockChainAdapter`** has zero tests. API parity with `EVMChainAdapter` unverified — fixture drift will silently break downstream tests. |
| CH-9 | High | TEST-DEBT / NEW | **`NoChainAdapter` partial coverage.** Tests omit `createKnowledgeAssetsV10`, `getKnowledgeAssetsV10Address`, `getEvmChainId`, `isV10Ready`. Should be a systematic matrix of "every method throws" with stable message. |
| CH-10 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`enrichEvmError`** only tested for `unknown custom error data="..."` shape. Real RPCs format reverts differently → #159 raw revert leak class. |
| CH-11 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`FairSwapJudge.disputeDelivery`** is implemented but never called in tests. |
| CH-12 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No regression tests named for #150 / #151 / #163.** Future failures won't auto-link to known issues. |
| CH-13 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | **`createTestContextGraph` / `seedContextGraphRegistration`** helpers are unused inside `packages/chain/test` (consumed only from publisher). Helper bugs propagate. |
| CH-14 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | **`hardhat-harness.deployContracts`** parses Hub address via regex from stdout. Brittle if logging format changes. No test for parser. |
| CH-15 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No `batchMintKnowledgeAssets`, `registerIdentity`, `ensureProfile` tests** in chain package. |
| CH-16 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No `verify` (`registerKnowledgeCollection`) test** — VERIFY M-of-N submission to chain. |
| CH-17 | Low | SPEC-GAP | View helpers (`getContextGraphParticipants`, `listContextGraphsFromChain`, `revealContextGraphMetadata`) untested. |
| CH-18 | Low | TEST-DEBT | `nextAuthorizedSigner` "no wallet authorized" path uncovered. |

### packages/storage (TORNADO) — 4 test files

**Mocks:** Blazegraph "parity" file uses an HTTP stub that returns hard-coded COUNT — not a real engine.

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| ST-1 | Critical | WRONG-EXPECT / NEW | **`adapter-parity.test.ts` is misleadingly named.** It compares Oxigraph against a mock that returns hard-coded COUNT responses — not real Blazegraph. Same SPARQL/same result (the spec's "parity") is **not** verified anywhere. |
| ST-2 | Critical | PROD-BUG / NEW | **`PrivateContentStore` is NOT encrypted.** README claims "encrypted private storage"; `src/private-store.ts` only remaps quads into the `_private` graph. **Plaintext on disk.** Either implement encryption or fix the doc — currently misleading users about confidentiality guarantees. |
| ST-3 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No named-graph isolation test using real V10 graph URIs** (`contextGraphSharedMemoryUri`, `contextGraphVerifiedMemoryUri`, `contextGraphPrivateUri`). Axiom 5 (graph isolation) is structurally untested. |
| ST-4 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #38 #39 | **Dual-graph leak tests missing.** No test that public SPARQL via the data graph excludes `_private`. Critical for confidentiality model. |
| ST-5 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **`oxigraph-persistent` durability untested.** No test that closes/reopens the store from the same path and recovers all quads. Crash-between-flush-and-close window unguarded. |
| ST-6 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No concurrent-write test.** Parallel `insert` / `deleteByPattern` on the same graph — lost-update behavior unspecified by tests. |
| ST-7 | High | SPEC-GAP / NEW | **No SPARQL injection negative tests** in `PrivateContentStore`. `assertSafeIri` is invoked but no test crafts a malicious `rootEntity` and asserts rejection. |
| ST-8 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No `DESCRIBE` test** on any adapter despite adapters routing it as CONSTRUCT. Different return semantics could regress silently. |
| ST-9 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No `ASK` test as a first-class query** on Oxigraph (mock-only). |
| ST-10 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No duplicate-insert test** (insert same quad twice; assert RDF set semantics). |
| ST-11 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No bulk insert / scale test** (100k+ triples, transactional or partial). |
| ST-12 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / DUP #34 | **N-Quads typed literal regression** is partially covered via the escaping suite, but no test is named or documented as a #34 regression. |
| ST-13 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No vector storage** in this package despite spec doc 21 (tri-modal). Acceptable if vectors live elsewhere — but no contract test confirms that. |
| ST-14 | Low | TEST-DEBT | **`oxigraph-worker` skipped** when compiled `.js` worker missing — reasonable for dev, but CI should always build artifacts and run worker E2E. |

### packages/cli (BURA) — 32 test files

**Mocks:** API client is mocked-only; daemon HTTP API has very thin route-level coverage. Many integration tests use real daemons.

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLI-1 | Critical | SPEC-GAP / DUP #11 | **Keystore uses scrypt + AES-GCM** (good), but **no test asserts KDF parameter floor** (cost N, r, p). Weak params would still pass. |
| CLI-2 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #76 | **CORS policy for JSON API is not tested.** Only static-app token-injection is checked. Wildcard on `/api/*` would not fail any test. |
| CLI-3 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #77 | **No rate-limit enforcement test for non-loopback clients.** Only `shouldBypassRateLimitForLoopbackTraffic` is unit-tested; the actual 429 path is uncovered. |
| CLI-4 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #78 | **Malformed JSON body → status code untested.** Spec says 400; current behavior unverified. |
| CLI-5 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #86 | **Oversized body → 413 untested.** |
| CLI-6 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #88 | **`POST /api/chat` timeout / hang untested.** Could hang indefinitely. |
| CLI-7 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #72 #85 | **SPARQL endpoint status matrix untested:** mutation rejection, whitespace-only, invalid peer, duplicate CG → all return correct 4xx, not 500. |
| CLI-8 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #83 | **CONSTRUCT + access control untested.** Could expose data without capability check. |
| CLI-9 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #158 #159 | **CCL/verify not-found returns 500;** **chain raw revert leaks in 500 body.** Both untested. |
| CLI-10 | High | SPEC-GAP | **Signed-request auth and replay protection** (spec §18) — zero tests in `packages/cli/test`. `auth.js` is Bearer-only. Either spec is unimplemented or the implementation lives somewhere untested. |
| CLI-11 | High | SPEC-GAP | **Token rotation / revocation untested.** Issuance is covered; rotation is not. |
| CLI-12 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **Single-instance daemon lock untested** — second daemon should fail cleanly; only pid file write is tested. |
| CLI-13 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / DUP #71 | **Shutdown signal → exit code mapping untested.** |
| CLI-14 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / DUP #82 | **`pruneTimer` cleanup on shutdown untested.** Code clears it; test does not assert. |
| CLI-15 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / DUP #79 #80 #81 | **Internal error mapping untested for `lookupByUAL`, `Promise.race` timer leak in SPARQL executor, `chat-persistence-queue` unhandled rejection.** |
| CLI-16 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / DUP #87 | **Path traversal in CG IDs untested for daemon routes.** Only static-app paths covered. |
| CLI-17 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **`api-client.test.ts` is fully mocked** — no live daemon round-trip test for the client API surface. |

---

### packages/query (BURA) — 5 test files

**Mocks:** none in core engine/handler tests — uses real `OxigraphStore`. Strong baseline.

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-1 | High | PROD-BUG / NEW | **`QueryOptions._minTrust` is declared but never enforced** by `DKGQueryEngine`. Spec §14 trust-gradient filter is decorative right now. Either implement or document as not-yet-shipped, but tests should fail one way or the other. |
| Q-2 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #83 | **Remote SPARQL `executeSparql` only returns `bindings`** — CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE quads never returned over the wire. Behavior contract undefined and untested. |
| Q-3 | High | SPEC-GAP | **`working-memory` view resolution untested.** Implemented in `resolveViewGraphs` but no test exercises it. SHARED/VERIFIED/`all` partially tested. |
| Q-4 | High | SPEC-GAP / DUP #80 | **No end-to-end timeout test** for slow queries. Race+clearTimeout looks correct in code; no test forces the timeout path or asserts `GAS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`. |
| Q-5 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **Context Oracle proof params (spec §14)** not mapped to query tests at all. |
| Q-6 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | **`QueryHandler` swallows all errors → generic "Internal error"** — specific failure modes hard to test. Error taxonomy missing. |

---

### packages/attested-assets (BURA) — 8 test files

**Mocks:** `InMemorySessionManager` stub used in `session-routes.test.ts`. Otherwise real session/validator/canonical paths.

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| AA-1 | High | TEST-DEBT | **`session-routes.test.ts` uses an in-memory stub manager** rather than real `SessionManager`. Routes pass even if real manager semantics diverge. |
| AA-2 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No integration test running real `SessionManager` + real validator + real gossip** for one full quorum round. Each component is tested in isolation. |
| AA-3 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No positive test that valid gossip messages dispatch correctly.** Only negative ("malformed → no dispatch") is covered. |
| AA-4 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / DUP #18 #14 | **Extension governance** (spec §18 — capability allowlist, version range) not reflected in attested-assets tests. |

---

### packages/mcp-server (KOSAVA) — 2 test files

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| K-1 | High | HIDES-BUG / NEW | **`tools.test.ts` inlines a copy of tool registration logic** with a stub `trackingClient` — does NOT import the production server entry. Production parity is unverified; a tool removed from prod would still pass tests. |
| K-2 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No `mcp_auth` test.** `mcp_auth` doesn't exist in `packages/mcp-server/src` either — feature gap if spec requires it. |
| K-3 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No MCP transport lifecycle test** (stdio / SSE), no reconnect, no token refresh. Only `DkgClient.connect` is covered with stub `fetch`. |

---

### packages/network-sim (KOSAVA) — 2 test files

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| K-4 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No determinism test.** Same seed, same operations, same output hash — would catch sim drift. |
| K-5 | Medium | SPEC-GAP | **No libp2p parity test.** Sim engine is supposed to mirror real p2p behavior; no two-node scenario validates this. |

---

### packages/epcis (KOSAVA) — 6 test files

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| K-6 | High | TEST-DEBT | **`epcis-api.e2e.test.ts` `beforeEach` skips entire suite when node unreachable.** Most CI runs likely skip the integration test entirely. Either gate to a CI job with always-on devnet or convert to contract tests against a controlled stub. |

---

### packages/origin-trail-game (KOSAVA) — 4 e2e test files, thin unit coverage

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| G-1 | **Critical** | **PROD-BUG / NEW** | **`packages/origin-trail-game/src/dkg/coordinator.ts:766-774`** calls `this.agent.createContextGraph({ participantIdentityIds, requiredSignatures })` and then reads `result.success` + `result.contextGraphId`. But `DKGAgent.createContextGraph()` in `packages/agent/src/dkg-agent.ts:2877` returns **`Promise<void>`** — there is no `success` or `contextGraphId` field. At runtime this raises `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'success')`, which is swallowed by the surrounding `try/catch` and logged as `Context graph creation failed (game proceeds without on-chain anchoring)`. The game silently falls back to no-op: no on-chain context graph is ever registered, `swarm.contextGraphId` stays `undefined`, and every downstream assertion (`swarm.status === 'traveling'`, `currentTurn === N`, `Context graph.*created.*M=...`, etc.) fails. The intended target is clearly `DKGAgent.registerContextGraphOnChain(params)` (line 2459), which *does* return `Promise<CreateOnChainContextGraphResult>` with `contextGraphId`, `txHash`, `blockNumber`, etc. — the game was written against a method signature that no longer exists. Surfaced by all 4 `kosava-game-e2e` shards once the test-harness port/selector/core-role bugs (ex-CI-2) were fixed. |

### KOSAVA adapters — `adapter-openclaw` (7), `adapter-elizaos` (1), `adapter-hermes` (1), `adapter-autoresearch` (2)

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| K-7 | High | HIDES-BUG / NEW | **`adapter-openclaw/dkg-client.test.ts` mocks `fetch` for everything.** No real HTTP timeout, no `AbortSignal` test, no chunked-response error test. Network failure modes invisible. |
| K-8 | High | HIDES-BUG / NEW | **`adapter-openclaw/dkg-memory.test.ts` assumes binding shape `{ uri: { value }, text: { value } }`** in mocks. If `/api/query` shape drifts, all memory tests still pass while production breaks. |
| K-9 | Medium | SPEC-GAP / DUP #35 | **`openclaw.plugin.json` `id` vs `package.json` name** — no contract test asserts they line up. #35 class regression. |
| K-10 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | **`adapter-openclaw` channel tests heavily mock the daemon** for chat-turn persistence (#199, #207, #215 themes). Good as regression guards but not proof against server bugs. |
| K-11 | Medium | TEST-DEBT | **`adapter-elizaos`** is smoke-only; spec §09A_FRAMEWORK_ADAPTERS contract not exercised (chat persistence hook, node-as-SoT). |
| K-12 | Low | TEST-DEBT | **`adapter-autoresearch`** explicitly delegates real behavior to `sdk-js`. Documented; no cross-package contract test. |

## Pending audit work: NONE

All TORNADO + BURA + KOSAVA packages have been audited. Total **~120 findings**.

---

## Test-writing plan (next phase)

Plan: write tests for every finding above where a test can plausibly catch a real bug. Order by impact:

1. **TORNADO crypto + protocol** (C-1..C-14) — most likely to surface a real signing/encoding bug
2. **TORNADO publisher** (P-1..P-19) — write-ahead, fencing, ACK replay across cost params
3. **TORNADO chain** (CH-1..CH-18) — RPC failure matrix, ABI pinning, raw-log decoding
4. **TORNADO evm-module** (E-1..E-19) — Hub reinitialize, unstake, ACK cost-param replay, double-emit
5. **TORNADO storage** (ST-1..ST-14) — encryption claim verification, named-graph isolation, durability
6. **TORNADO agent** (A-1..A-15) — multi-agent isolation, SWM first-writer-wins, ENDORSE replay
7. **BURA cli + query + attested-assets** — HTTP status matrix, minTrust, real SessionManager round-trip
8. **KOSAVA cleanup** — adapter-openclaw real fetch, mcp-server production parity, openclaw.plugin.json contract

**Mocks policy:** any new test we add uses real implementations end-to-end where possible. Where orchestration testing genuinely needs a stub (e.g. injecting an unreachable peer), the test is paired with an e2e backstop and the comment explains why.

**No production code, no spec doc edits.** If a test fails because the spec describes a behavior the code doesn't implement, the test stays red and the failure is a finding.

## Coverage sweep — follow-up pass (2026-04-20)

Verified that the broader v10 flow is covered end-to-end. Two additional gaps were closed:

| # | Severity | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| COV-1 | Medium | TEST-DEBT / fixed | **`packages/cli/src/vector-store.ts` (212 lines, Tri-Modal Memory spec §21) had zero tests.** Added `packages/cli/test/vector-store-extra.test.ts` — 18 tests covering WAL durability, migration idempotency, INSERT-OR-REPLACE dedup, cosine math edge cases (identity, orthogonal, zero-vector), CG isolation, WM/SWM/VM layer filtering, CHECK-constraint enforcement of the memory-layer enum, dimension-mismatch skip, top-K ordering, minSimilarity cutoff, delete semantics, and float32 round-trip precision. All green. |
| COV-2 | Medium | TEST-DEBT / fixed | **`ChainEventPoller` (spec §5.1 / §6) happy path covered by `publish-lifecycle.test.ts`; edges were not.** Added `packages/publisher/test/chain-event-poller-extra.test.ts` — 14 tests covering cursor persistence across restart, load() error non-fatality, seed-cursor-near-head-500 when idle, non-seed when pending (early-block events not lost), MAX_RANGE (9000-block) capping across multiple polls, callback dispatch for `KnowledgeCollectionUpdated` + `AllowListUpdated` + `ProfileCreated/Updated` (the 3 paths publish-lifecycle omits), KCCreated vs KnowledgeBatchCreated routing parity, callback-fault isolation (one throw doesn't abort the poll), and idempotent start/stop. All green. |

### Spec-ahead-of-code (documented as SPEC-GAPs — no test written because no src to point at)

| # | Severity | Spec section | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| SG-1 | High | §20 — Protocol URL Scheme | No `dkg://` URL parser exists in any `src/` directory. Spec defines the scheme; implementation is missing. Flagged for V10 implementation; when added, parser + resolver needs dedicated tests. |
| SG-2 | High | §16 — Graph Reasoning | No SHACL / N3 / EYE reasoner module exists in src. Spec defines three layers (validation / inference / governance); CCL governance is partially implemented (used in `origin-trail-game/test/e2e/game-ccl-e2e.test.ts`). Validation + inference layers missing. |
| SG-3 | Medium | §04/05 — Knowledge Commerce | No `x402` micropayment code in src. Spec defines it as V10.0; code not started. |
| SG-4 | Medium | §12 — Benchmarks | No dedicated benchmark suite. Performance targets (PUBLISH throughput, query latency, sync performance) have no measurement harness. |
| SG-5 | Low | §15 — Observability | Node-UI has `metrics-collector.test.ts`; CLI daemon has `/api/health` test (`daemon-http-behavior-extra`) but no Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint test. Depends on whether CLI daemon is expected to expose Prometheus per spec §15. |

No further gaps located where production code exists without any test coverage after this sweep.

## CI infrastructure issues (historical — both RESOLVED)

These were CI-environment test-harness problems (not product bugs) that are now structurally fixed. Recorded here so the investigation trail isn't lost.

| # | Lane | Symptom | Root cause | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CI-1 | `Kosava: origin-trail-game E2E` | `Daemon already running (PID N). Use "dkg stop" first.` + `EADDRINUSE: 0.0.0.0:19301` *between* test files | The 4 e2e files share a single `.test-nodes/` directory + ports 19200-19302 + 18545. Cleanup between files is unreliable on 2-core ubuntu-latest runners. | **RESOLVED** — `kosava-game-e2e` sharded 1-file-per-ephemeral-runner (`[1/4]`..`[4/4]`). Each shard boots a fresh runner, runs exactly one e2e file, and is torn down; cross-file pollution is structurally impossible. |
| CI-2 | `Kosava: origin-trail-game E2E` | `UnsupportedListenAddressesError: /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/19301: EADDRINUSE` *within* a single file, ~6-8s after daemon spawn, even with `DKG_NO_BLUE_GREEN=1` skipping the release-slot migration | Node 2 (libp2p port 19301) fails to bind during concurrent boot of nodes 2 + 3 on 2-core `ubuntu-latest` runners. The `dkg start --foreground` supervisor → worker handoff briefly holds the libp2p port after a silent restart; on slow runners the kernel's TIME_WAIT window hasn't cleared before the next worker tries to bind. | **RESOLVED** — `helpers.ts::pickFreePortRange` now allocates a probed-free random port window (API + libp2p + Hardhat, all in `20000-30000` above the ephemeral range) at the start of every cluster run. Each port is individually probed via `net.createServer().listen(port, '0.0.0.0')` and released before the DKG daemon spawns, so (a) two concurrent CI workers can never collide and (b) a stale kernel hold would cause the probe to fail and a different port to be picked on retry. `continue-on-error: true` has been removed from `kosava-game-e2e` — every remaining failure on this lane is a real product bug. |
