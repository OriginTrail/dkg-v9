   * the on-chain data extracted from the matching
   * `KnowledgeBatchCreated` / `KCCreated` event. We:

   *   2. Sanity-check the on-chain publisher matches the persisted
   *      one — a mismatch means a different node confirmed an
   *      identical batch (extremely unlikely, but treat the WAL
   *      entry as still-pending and DO NOT drop it).
   *   3. Drop the entry from the in-memory journal AND atomically
   *      rewrite the WAL file with the surviving entries (so the
   *      next restart doesn't re-discover the same already-confirmed
   *      intent and try to re-recover it).
   *   4. Emit a structured `WAL_RECOVERY_MATCH` log + an
   *      `EventBus` event so operators can observe the recovery
   *      stream end-to-end (matches the existing
   *      `WAL recovery: loaded …` log on the constructor side).
   *
   * in
   * addition to dropping the WAL entry we now ALSO promote the
   * tentative KC status quad to `confirmed` in the context graph's
   * meta graph, matching what `PublishHandler.confirmPublish` does
   * on the happy path. Without this, a restart-across-crash left the
   * KC permanently stuck in `status "tentative"` even though the
   * on-chain event confirmed the publish — callers querying
   * `view: 'verified-memory'` or filtering by `status confirmed`
   * would continue to treat the KC as unfinalised. We locate the
   * KC UAL by querying the `_meta` graph for a subject whose
   * `dkg:merkleRoot` matches the WAL entry's merkleRoot AND whose
   * `dkg:status` is still `"tentative"`. When the store has already
   * dropped the tentative quad (e.g. timed out, or this node crashed
   * before writing it) the promotion is skipped with a log line and
   * the WAL entry is still dropped — the bot's "accumulate forever"
   * condition is driven by the WAL, not the store.
   *
   * Returns the recovered entry on success (so callers can record
   * structured telemetry / surface it through their own
   * observability pipeline) or `undefined` when no WAL entry
   * matches the merkle root.

    // counts toward quorum; the V10 contract enforces "each sig must be

    // on-chain.

    // The earlier strict `perCgRequired > 0 && collectedAckCount <

    // (curated CG with the creator as sole participant, integration

    // accept the self-signed participant ACK. The right semantic is:
    // "after accounting for the one self-sign we *would* add, do we still
    // fall short?" — which is what `effectiveAckCount` captures below.
    //
    // the earlier gate scoped
    // `selfSignEligible` to `v10ACKs.length === 0`, which incorrectly denied
    // the publisher's own participant ACK whenever ANY peer ACK had already
    // arrived. In an M-of-N context graph where (peer ACKs + local
    // participant ACK) would satisfy quorum, that short-circuit forced a
    // tentative publish even though the on-chain contract would accept the
    // combined set. The eligibility check is now "publisher identity is not
    // already represented in v10ACKs"; the self-sign block below then
    // APPENDS (not replaces) and dedupes by identityId.
    // ask the chain whether our identity is actually allowed
    // to ACK for this CG before letting the self-sign satisfy quorum
    // locally. The V10 contract rejects "self-sign by a non-
    // participant" with `InvalidSignerNotParticipant`, so without
    // this gate we'd happily build a tx that's guaranteed to revert
    // AND mark a tentative publish as locally "ready" based on a
    // signature that doesn't count. We only run the lookup when:
    //   - the adapter exposes `getContextGraphParticipants` (real EVM,
    //     non-trivial mock fixtures), AND
    //   - we have a positive numeric CG id (descriptive SWM names
    //     resolve to `0n`, which the V10 contract itself rejects
    //     before any participant check matters).

    // contract not deployed); we preserve the historical lenient
    // path by treating the answer as unknown.

    // been rejected at the write boundary by `rejectReservedSubjectPrefixes`
    // . User-
    // authored writes with `urn:dkg:file:*` or `urn:dkg:extraction:*`
    // subjects are short-circuited at `assertionWrite`, `share`,
    // `conditionalShare`, and non-`fromSharedMemory` `publish` entry
    // points. This promote-time filter is kept as a belt-and-suspenders
    // safety net for quads that legitimately enter the store through
    // a path that bypasses the write guard — namely the daemon's
    // import-file handler, which writes file descriptors and
    // ExtractionProvenance blocks via a direct `store.insert` call
    // (documented at `daemon.ts:2663-2668`) precisely because those
    // URN subjects are protocol-reserved and belong in WM/`_meta`,
    // not promoted SWM.
    //
    // The `<urn:dkg:file:...>` file descriptor block (rows 4-8 of the
    // §10.2 linkage table) and the `<urn:dkg:extraction:<uuid>>`
    // ExtractionProvenance block (rows 9-13) are subordinate metadata
    // about the extraction RUN, not semantic knowledge about an Entity.
    // Without this filter, `autoPartition` below would treat
    // `<urn:dkg:file:keccak256:abc>` as a root entity and cross-assertion
    // ownership would contend when two different assertions reference
    // the same file content (same keccak256 → same URN → same
    // ownership slot). Filtering the subject-prefix before partitioning
    // means:
    //   - Row 1 (`<entityUri> dkg:sourceFile <urn:dkg:file:...>`)
    //     SURVIVES because its subject is the doc entity, not the file
    //     URN — only OBJECTs are `urn:dkg:file:...`, not subjects. So
    //     SWM consumers still see "this entity came from this file".
    //   - Rows 4-5, 8 on `<fileUri>` are stripped — file descriptor
    //     absent from SWM. Content-addressed blob lookup remains
    //     available via the literal `dkg:sourceFileHash` in `_meta`.
    //   - Rows 9-13 on `<provUri>` are stripped — prov block absent
    //     from SWM.
    //
    // Because Bug 25's write-time guard means no user-authored data
    // in those namespaces can exist in the store, filtering by prefix
    // on promote cannot drop legitimate user data.
    //
    // See `19_MARKDOWN_CONTENT_TYPE.md §10.2` for the normative rule
    // and Codex Bug 8 Round 4 reconciled ruling for the history (Round
    // 3 tried blank-node subjects but an `autoPartition` audit showed
    // they silently drop rows 9-13 on promote, which was worse).
    // Round 12 Bug 35: source the prefix list from `RESERVED_SUBJECT_PREFIXES`
    // instead of hardcoding the two literals inline. If the reserved
    // namespace list ever gains a new prefix at the top of the file
    // (e.g., a future `urn:dkg:prov:` or `urn:dkg:ack:`), the promote
    // filter picks it up automatically without a separate code change —
    // single source of truth. The Round 9 write-time guard uses the
    // same constant, so both defenses always stay in sync.
    //
    // Round 14 Bug 41: use the case-insensitive `isReservedSubject`
    // helper instead of byte-level `startsWith`. Per RFC 8141 the URN
    // scheme and NID are case-insensitive, so `URN:dkg:file:...` is
