/**
 * PR #229 bot review round 16 (r16-2) + round 17 (r17-1): bounded cache
 * of user-message ids whose `onChatTurn` write completed successfully
 * IN THIS PROCESS, SCOPED PER RUNTIME.
 *
 * Context: r14-2 plumbed an explicit `userTurnPersisted` boolean up
 * to `persistChatTurnImpl`, and r15-2 ensured that even when the
 * plugin's own handler defaulted that flag to `false` the resulting
 * stub could not collide with the real user-message subject. But
 * the plugin's in-process `onChatTurn → onAssistantReply` chain
 * always runs the user-turn write successfully BEFORE the assistant
 * reply fires (ElizaOS hook ordering is synchronous per-turn), so
 * the "headless default" case makes readers like
 * `getSessionGraphDelta()` see an extra `dkg:hasUserMessage` stub
 * edge alongside the real one — readers can bind to the stub and
 * surface a blank turn.
 *
 * r16-2's first pass made the cache a single process-global Map.
 * r17-1 fixed the cross-agent leak: one process can legitimately
 * host MULTIPLE Eliza runtimes (multi-tenant daemon, test harness,
 * orchestrator). A successful `onChatTurn` in runtime A must NOT
 * make runtime B's `onAssistantReply` silently take the append-only
 * path for the same `(roomId, userMsgId)` coincidence — B never
 * wrote the user-turn envelope, so the reply would become
 * unreadable in B's graph.
 *
 * Fix: a `WeakMap<runtime, Map<key, true>>` — every runtime object
 * gets its own LRU Map; when the runtime is garbage-collected, its
 * entire cache disappears automatically (no leak on runtime
 * replacement). Each per-runtime Map is still bounded to
 * `PERSISTED_USER_TURN_CACHE_MAX` entries. Keys within a runtime
 * are `${roomId}\u0000${userMsgId}` (the same pair that determines
 * `turnKey` in `persistChatTurnImpl`).
 *
 * Fallback: if the caller invokes the hooks with a non-object
 * runtime (e.g. a `null` / `undefined` stub from a one-off script),
 * we degrade to a single "anonymous" per-process Map so the r16-2
 * in-process sharing property still holds for that caller. This
 * cannot bridge two runtimes because both of them would have to
 * be non-object to hit the fallback, which is not a realistic
 * multi-tenant shape.
 *
 * Only records onChatTurn RESOLUTIONS, not rejections. If the
 * user-turn write throws we deliberately NEVER record it so the
 * assistant reply falls through to the safe headless branch.

 * Bot review PR #229 round 24 (r24-2): the persisted-user-turn cache

 *
 * Before: key was `${roomId}\u0000${userMsgId}`. A caller that routed
 * the same `(roomId, userMsgId)` into two different stores — by
 * varying `options.contextGraphId` / `options.assertionName` between
 * `onChatTurn` and `onAssistantReply` — would see the second store's

 * runtime-global cache hit from the FIRST store's successful turn
 * write tricked `hasUserTurnBeenPersisted` into returning `true`),
 * leaving the second store with only `hasAssistantMessage` and no
 * user/session envelope.
 *
 * After: the key includes the resolved destination tuple
 * `(contextGraphId, assertionName)`, matching exactly the
 * `(contextGraphId, assertionName)` that `persistChatTurnImpl` will
 * use when it finally calls `agent.assertion.write(...)`. When the
 * caller does not override either, we resolve the same defaults
 * `persistChatTurnImpl` would (settings → env → constants) so the
 * two code paths agree.
 *
 * Implementation note: we intentionally do NOT add the destination
 * to `persistedUserTurnKey`'s arity; we instead compose
 * `resolveDestination` from the runtime + options and prefix the
 * key. This keeps the public helpers backward-compatible and the
 * change localised.

/**
 * Bot review A6 + 2nd-pass follow-ups (assistant-reply corruption /

 *
 *   1. Wiring `onChatTurn` AND `onAssistantReply` to the SAME
 *      `persistChatTurn` handler used to double-publish — the second call
 *      either re-emitted the whole turn (duplicate metadata + new
 *      timestamp) or recorded the assistant text AS `userMessage` because
 *      `persistChatTurnImpl` derived `userText` from `message.content.text`.
 *   2. Fix v1 (commit ce5983a6) added a dedicated `onAssistantReplyHandler`
 *      but still forwarded the assistant `Memory` straight through, which
 *      meant `message.content.text` was again read as `userMessage`.
 *   3. Fix v2 (this revision) introduces an explicit `mode:
 *      'assistant-reply'` flag on the persist call. In that mode
 *      `persistChatTurnImpl` skips the user-message + turn-envelope quads
 *      and only writes the assistant `schema:Message` subject + a single
 *      `dkg:hasAssistantMessage` link onto the existing turn. The user
 *      message id from the matching `onChatTurn` call is forwarded via
 *      `userMessageId` so both calls land on the SAME `urn:dkg:chat:turn:`
 *      / `urn:dkg:chat:msg:user:` URIs (deterministic per (roomId,
 *      messageId) tuple).
 *
 * Frameworks that fire only `onChatTurn` keep working — the user-turn
 * branch already accepts both user-only and user+assistant payloads
 * (`options.assistantText` / `state.lastAssistantReply`). Frameworks that
 * fire both hooks no longer corrupt the turn.
