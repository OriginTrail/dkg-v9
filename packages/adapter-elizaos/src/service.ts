 * write failed, reconnect replay), and the cheap-append-only path
 * produces unreadable assistant replies. Requiring the boolean on
 * the TYPED overload forces the caller to think about whether the
 * user turn really made it to disk before taking the append path.
 *

 *
 * PR #229 bot review (r30-8 — service.ts:128): pre-r30-8 a third
 * catch-all overload accepted `options?: Record<string, unknown>`

 * compile cleanly — defeating the entire compile-time enforcement
 * the typed overloads were added to provide. The runtime guard in
 * `persistChatTurnImpl` still threw, but only after the type check
 * had already let the bad call through.
 *
 * r30-8 fix: the catch-all is REMOVED from the public surface.
 *
 * PR #229 bot review (r31-2 — service.ts:133) restored a third
 * `@deprecated` catch-all overload directly on this interface to
 * preserve compile-time tolerance for dynamic-bag integrations.
 *
 * PR #229 bot review (r31-3 — service.ts:180) — the r31-2 placement
 * was wrong: even sitting AFTER the strict overloads in declaration
 * order, the catch-all turned `dkgService.persistChatTurn(…, { mode:
 * 'assistant-reply' })` (no `userMessageId` / `userTurnPersisted`)
 * into a clean compile again. TypeScript's overload algorithm tries
 * each signature in declaration order and reports an error only
 * when NONE match, so an object literal that fails overload 2
 * (missing the mandatory reply fields) still satisfied the catch-
 * all and the call compiled — exactly the smuggling hole r30-8
 * closed. The bot was right to flag this as reopening the hole;
 * the only safe placement for a dynamic-bag escape hatch is OFF the
 * main `dkgService` surface entirely.
 *
 * Final shape (r31-3): the public `DKGService` carries ONLY the
 * two typed overloads. Two named handles are available for callers
 * who legitimately need the wide options bag:
 *   - {@link dkgServiceLegacy} — `@deprecated` public handle that
 *     preserves the pre-r30-8 wide-`Record<string, unknown>`
 *     signature for downstream integrations that genuinely cannot
 *     narrow at the call site (e.g. framework adapters whose
 *     options shape is determined by the host). Same runtime impl
 *     as `dkgService` — same defence-in-depth guard inside
 *     `persistChatTurnImpl` — but with no compile-time enforcement
 *     of the typed contract.
 *   - {@link _dkgServiceLoose} — internal-only (underscore-
 *     prefixed) handle used by the adapter plugin wiring in
 *     `src/index.ts` for hook dispatch.
 *
 * Migration path: TS callers stay on `dkgService` and either narrow
 * their options to one of the typed shapes OR move to
 * `dkgServiceLegacy` with an explicit acknowledgement that the
 * compile-time contract is opt-out. `as any` callers are unaffected
 * — they were never type-checked.
