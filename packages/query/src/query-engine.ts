   * populated by a single trust-tier write path:
   *
   *   - root `did:dkg:context-graph:{id}` — chain-confirmed, SelfAttested.
   *   - `did:dkg:context-graph:{id}/_verified_memory/{quorum}` —
   *     populated by the quorum's verified-memory write path; the quorum
   *     identifier itself is the trust provenance.
   *
   * Semantics:
   *   - undefined or `SelfAttested`: union root + `/_verified_memory/*`.
   *   - Any value above `SelfAttested` (`Endorsed`, `PartiallyVerified`,
   *     `ConsensusVerified`): drop the root data graph, keep only
   *     `/_verified_memory/*` sub-graphs. This prevents SelfAttested
   *     chain data from bleeding into a high-trust query.
   *
   * Known gap (tracked as Q-1): surviving `/_verified_memory/*` graphs
   * are not filtered per-triple against a `dkg:trustLevel` predicate.
   * If upstream writers respect the one-trust-tier-per-graph invariant
   * this is safe; if a future writer stamps mixed-trust triples into a
   * single sub-graph the graph-scope filter will not catch it. Do not
   * rely on `minTrust` alone for a compliance-grade trust guarantee
   * until Q-1 lands.
