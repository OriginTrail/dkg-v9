/**
 * Manifest templates with {{placeholder}} substitution.
 *
 * The cursor-rule and AGENTS.md templates are intentionally NOT here
 * — those are sourced from the canonical files in the repo at
 * publish time (`.cursor/rules/dkg-annotate.mdc` and `AGENTS.md`)
 * so they stay in lockstep with what we actually ship locally.
 *
 * The hook templates and config template ARE here because they're
 * authored solely for distribution (not used as files in the repo
 * itself — the repo's `.cursor/hooks.json` is hand-edited per
 * machine; the manifest distributes a parameterised version).
 *
 * Three substitution forms are available for every placeholder listed
 * below (see schema.ts `substitutePlaceholders` for details):
 *   `{{name}}`       raw — for controlled, known-safe values (paths,
 *                   CG ids, URIs we mint ourselves)
 *   `{{sh:name}}`    POSIX-shell-quoted — use INSIDE shell command
 *                   lines so arbitrary chars can't inject commands
 *   `{{json:name}}`  JSON-string-literal (emits its own surrounding
 *                   quotes, valid in both JSON and YAML) — use for
 *                   free-form values like `agentNickname` that could
 *                   otherwise break the containing config file
 *
 * Substitutable placeholders (see schema.ts MANIFEST_PLACEHOLDERS):
 *   {{agentUri}}            urn:dkg:agent:<lowercase-wallet-address> — cryptographic identity
 *   {{agentNickname}}       human-readable label, e.g. "Brana laptop 1" — use {{json:agentNickname}} in JSON/YAML contexts
 *   {{agentAddress}}        raw lowercase wallet address (0x-prefixed)
 *   {{agentSlug}}           BACK-COMPAT alias for nickname (slug-shaped)
 *   {{contextGraphId}}      CG id
 *   {{daemonApiUrl}}        local daemon API URL
 *   {{daemonTokenFile}}     relative path to auth.token
 *   {{workspaceAbsPath}}    absolute workspace path
 *   {{mcpDkgDistAbsPath}}   absolute path to @origintrail-official/dkg-mcp/dist/index.js
 *                           (what Cursor/Claude run; resolved via Node module
 *                           resolution so npm-global installs work too)
 *   {{mcpDkgPackageDir}}    absolute path to the resolved @origintrail-official/dkg-mcp package
 *   {{mcpDkgSrcAbsPath}}    absolute path to src/index.ts (monorepo checkouts only —
 *                           NOT shipped in the published tarball; kept for
 *                           legacy templates and `tsx`-based dev flows)
 *   {{captureScriptPath}}   absolute path to @origintrail-official/dkg-mcp/hooks/capture-chat.mjs
 *   {{network}}             testnet / mainnet / devnet
 */

/**
 * `<workspace>/.cursor/hooks.json` — wires capture-chat.mjs to all
 * four Cursor session events with the right env vars baked in.
 *
 * Every placeholder that lands inside a shell command line uses the
 * `{{sh:...}}` form so `substitutePlaceholders` POSIX-shell-quotes the
 * value. Unquoted interpolation would let a path containing `$(...)`,
 * backticks, or a space inject arbitrary commands into the hook that
