/**
 * CCL policy for governing turn resolutions in the OriginTrail Game.
 *
 * This policy is the authority for whether a turn is valid. Both leader
 * and followers evaluate it independently — same facts produce same output.
 *
 * Quorum is M-of-N (required_signatures from context graph config).
 * This means the game continues even if some players are offline,
 * as long as enough players voted to meet the threshold.
 *
 * The policy also verifies the winning action is the actual majority
 * choice from the votes — a leader cannot claim an arbitrary winner.
 *
 * CCL outputs:
 * - has_quorum(Swarm, Turn)           → derived: enough players voted
 * - winner_matches_claim(Swarm, Turn) → derived: claimed winner matches majority
 * - valid_turn(Swarm, Turn)           → derived: quorum + active + correct winner
 * - propose_publish(Swarm, Turn)      → decision: turn is valid, publish it
 * - flag_review(Swarm, Turn)          → decision: turn proposed but invalid
