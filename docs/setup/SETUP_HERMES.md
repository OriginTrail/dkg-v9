# Setting Up DKG V10 with Hermes Agent

This guide connects a Hermes profile to a local DKG V10 node. It reflects the
current PR behavior: profile-aware DKG setup helpers, DKG as an optional Hermes
memory provider, and DKG daemon-owned local-agent routes under
`/api/hermes-channel/*`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ and pnpm for this DKG monorepo.
- A DKG node configured with `dkg init`.
- Hermes Agent installed on Linux, macOS, WSL2, or Termux.

Hermes does not support native Windows. On Windows, run Hermes inside WSL2. A
DKG daemon may still run on Windows, but the Hermes profile must use a daemon
URL that is reachable from WSL.

## Profile Paths

Hermes scopes profile state through `HERMES_HOME`.

| Target | Hermes home |
| --- | --- |
| default profile | `~/.hermes` |
| named profile | `~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>` |
| explicit `HERMES_HOME` | the exact path in `HERMES_HOME` |

DKG setup follows the same rule. For example:

```bash
dkg hermes setup --profile research
```

targets `~/.hermes/profiles/research`.

## Provider Mode Setup

Use provider mode when DKG should be Hermes' active external memory provider.

```bash
dkg start
dkg hermes setup --profile research
dkg hermes verify --profile research
```

Setup writes only adapter-owned artifacts inside the selected Hermes profile:

- `dkg.json`
- `plugins/dkg`
- `.dkg-adapter-hermes/setup-state.json`
- a managed `memory.provider: dkg` block in `config.yaml`

The adapter refuses to overwrite an existing non-DKG memory provider. If the
profile already uses Honcho, Mem0, Supermemory, or another provider, choose
tools-only mode or switch providers explicitly.

## Tools-Only Setup

Use tools-only mode when Hermes should keep its current memory provider but
still have DKG profile state and local-agent registration metadata.

```bash
dkg hermes setup --profile research --memory-mode tools-only
```

Tools-only mode preserves `memory.provider` in `config.yaml`. It still writes
adapter state and installs the provider package files so `status`, `doctor`,
`disconnect`, `reconnect`, and `uninstall` can inspect and repair the
DKG/Hermes profile relationship. Model-injected DKG memory tools require
provider mode in this PR.

`--memory-mode ask` is reserved for a future interactive setup flow and is not
supported in this PR.

## CLI Helpers

```bash
dkg hermes setup --profile research --dry-run
dkg hermes setup --profile research --gateway-url https://hermes.example.com
dkg hermes status --profile research
dkg hermes verify --profile research
dkg hermes doctor --profile research
dkg hermes disconnect --profile research
dkg hermes reconnect --profile research
dkg hermes uninstall --profile research
```

`status`, `verify`, and `doctor` inspect the profile path and setup-state
metadata. `disconnect` removes only the managed provider election block and
marks the DKG adapter disconnected. `uninstall` removes ownership-marked DKG
adapter artifacts and preserves user-owned Hermes data.

Lifecycle commands reuse persisted daemon and bridge settings from
`setup-state.json` when flags are omitted, so a profile configured with a
custom daemon URL or gateway does not fall back to localhost during
`disconnect`, `reconnect`, or `uninstall`.

## Local-Agent Chat

The DKG daemon exposes these Hermes-specific routes. They are supported daemon
routes, not standalone HTTP handlers exported by `packages/adapter-hermes`:

```text
GET  /api/hermes-channel/health
POST /api/hermes-channel/send
POST /api/hermes-channel/stream
POST /api/hermes-channel/persist-turn
```

The daemon defaults to a standalone Hermes bridge at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:9202/{health,send,stream}
```

If the local-agent registry has a Hermes gateway URL, the daemon forwards to:

```text
<gateway-url>/api/hermes-channel/{health,send,stream}
```

`dkg hermes setup` registers only the Hermes channel kind by default. Use
`--bridge-url` for a same-host loopback bridge or `--gateway-url` for WSL2 and
remote Hermes deployments. Do not use a non-loopback `bridgeUrl`; remote
targets should be registered as gateways.

Node UI chat is considered ready only when the bridge or gateway health route
responds successfully. When it is unavailable, Hermes may still be registered,
but the UI should show a degraded/offline bridge state.

## Auth And Security

- DKG daemon API calls use bearer auth from the node.
- The Python Hermes provider reads the DKG token from `$DKG_HOME/auth.token` or
  `~/.dkg/auth.token`.
- Setup registration uses an explicit token environment variable when present,
  then falls back to `$DKG_HOME/auth.token` or `~/.dkg/auth.token`.
- Standalone loopback bridge calls use `x-dkg-bridge-token`. Non-loopback
  `bridgeUrl` values are ignored; use `gatewayUrl` for remote transports.
  Gateway targets do not receive that bridge token.
- Hermes `send` and `stream` require an enabled local-agent registration.
  `persist-turn` remains bearer-authenticated for provider persistence even
  when UI chat registration is unavailable.
- Adapter setup stores non-secret settings in `dkg.json`.
- Direct `dkg_publish` is guarded by default and should remain
  operator-reviewed unless explicitly enabled.

## Troubleshooting

### Provider conflict

If setup reports an existing `memory.provider`, either keep that provider with:

```bash
dkg hermes setup --profile research --memory-mode tools-only
```

or edit the Hermes profile config intentionally before rerunning provider mode.

### Bridge offline

If Node UI says Hermes is degraded or offline:

1. Confirm Hermes is running for the same profile.
2. Confirm the bridge is listening on `127.0.0.1:9202`, or configure the DKG
   local-agent integration with the correct gateway URL.
3. Run:

```bash
dkg hermes doctor --profile research
```

4. Refresh the Hermes connected-agent panel in the Node UI.

### Windows and WSL2

Run Hermes inside WSL2. If the DKG daemon runs on Windows, do not rely on
`127.0.0.1` until you have verified reachability from WSL. Use an explicit
daemon URL:

```bash
dkg hermes setup --profile research --daemon-url http://<windows-host-ip>:9200
```

### Uninstall and reconnect

`disconnect` is reversible:

```bash
dkg hermes disconnect --profile research
dkg hermes reconnect --profile research
```

Use `uninstall` when you want to remove adapter-owned files:

```bash
dkg hermes uninstall --profile research
```

## Release Smoke Checklist

Before release, record evidence for:

- provider-mode setup and verify
- tools-only setup with an existing memory provider
- duplicate setup idempotency
- provider conflict refusal
- Node UI connect, stream, refresh, and persisted history
- daemon restart recovery
- Hermes restart recovery
- disconnect, reconnect, and uninstall
- Windows/WSL2 reachability with an explicit daemon URL

Automated tests cover the TypeScript adapter, CLI option normalization, daemon
Hermes routes, duplicate persist behavior, local-agent readiness transitions,
and Node UI Hermes transport helpers. Manual smoke evidence is still required
for release sign-off.
