/**
 * Durable direct-channel marker lifecycle:
 * `markExternalTurnPersistedDurable` creates content-bound markers only after
 * channel-side daemon `storeChatTurn` succeeds; marker keys include `turnId`
 * plus canonical user/assistant text to avoid false dedupe for reused IDs or
 * content. W4a matches them in `consumeExternalTurnMarkersForPair` during
 * `runAgentEndPersist`, advancing pair watermarks only after durable commit.
 * Create failures roll back marker snapshots when `commitWatermarkStateSync`
 * fails; `setStateDir` migrates per-session `m`
 * markers, and graceful `DkgChannelPlugin.stop()` drains in-flight first writes.
 * Telegram persistence can arrive through typed `message_received/message_sent`
 * when typed `agent_end` is silent. Those events are normalized into the W4b
 * envelope and deduped against internal `message:received/message:sent` by
 * channel/account/conversation/messageId, outside the Node-UI marker space.
 * Typed W4b replay markers are retained and bound to provider message IDs so
 * repeated reset/compaction replays skip same-text occurrences safely.

   * T18/T21/T22 — Migrate this writer to a new stateDir without losing

   * Steps (in order):
   *   1. `await flush()` — drain in-flight persists, pending resets,
   *      and per-session agent_end chains so we have a stable
   *      in-memory snapshot at the OLD path. T21 regression fix:
   *      pre-fix the migration used `flushSync()`, which only wrote
   *      the debounced watermark and missed in-flight `storeChatTurn`
   *      jobs that completed after the swap.
   *   2. Read the destination watermark file (if any) and MERGE
   *      per-session via max(w) and max(b). T22 regression fix:
   *      pre-fix unconditionally overwrote the destination, which
   *      rolled back newer state from a prior run at the workspace
   *      path. The destination file's session keys may also reference
   *      conversations this process never touched — those are
   *      preserved unchanged.
   *   3. Update internal paths atomically.
   *   4. Write the merged state to the new location.
   *   5. Best-effort delete the old file so a future fallback resolve
   *      doesn't repopulate from stale data.
