## 1. Networking & Sync

### 1.1 Persistent triple store — **DONE**
Oxigraph store persists to `~/.dkg/store.nq` via N-Quads dump/load.
Data survives node restarts.

- **Spec**: [sync-flow.md](../diagrams/sync-flow.md) (Persistence lifecycle section)

### 1.2 Paranet sync on connect — **DONE**
New `/dkg/sync/1.0.0` protocol. On `peer:connect`, nodes request the
agents paranet from peers to catch up on profiles they missed via GossipSub.
Paginated (500 triples/page) with merkle root verification.

- **Spec**: [sync-flow.md](../diagrams/sync-flow.md)

### 1.3 On-chain sync verification (Tier 2) — **NEEDS SPEC**
After syncing and verifying merkle roots locally (Tier 1), cross-check
against the blockchain: query on-chain KC records to confirm the merkle
roots are actually anchored. This catches a peer that forges both data
and metadata.

Also detects **omitted KCs** — the blockchain has the authoritative list
of all KCs published to a paranet; a peer that withholds entire KCs can
be detected by comparing on-chain KC count vs received KC count.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_SYNC_CHAIN_VERIFICATION.md](../specs/SPEC_SYNC_CHAIN_VERIFICATION.md) — **TO CREATE**

### 1.4 Profile exchange on connect — **NEEDS SPEC**
Pairwise profile exchange: when two peers connect, they directly swap
their own agent profiles (not the whole paranet). Lightweight complement
to full paranet sync — useful when the connecting peer only needs to know
about the immediate neighbor.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_PROFILE_EXCHANGE.md](../specs/SPEC_PROFILE_EXCHANGE.md) — **TO CREATE**

### 1.5 Cross-agent query protocol — **DONE**
Agents query each other's knowledge stores remotely via `/dkg/query/2.0.0`.
Structured lookups (ENTITY_BY_UAL, ENTITIES_BY_TYPE, ENTITY_TRIPLES, SPARQL_QUERY)
with access policies, rate limiting, and optional LLM. CLI `query-remote`, daemon API.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_CROSS_AGENT_QUERY.md](../specs/SPEC_CROSS_AGENT_QUERY.md)

### 1.6 Relay auto-discovery — **NEEDS SPEC**
Nodes currently need the relay multiaddr in config. Relay addresses should
be discoverable from the blockchain or a well-known on-chain registry so
new nodes can bootstrap without manual config.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_RELAY_DISCOVERY.md](../specs/SPEC_RELAY_DISCOVERY.md) — **TO CREATE**

---

## 2. Publishing & Knowledge

### 2.1 Private KA access protocol — **READY**
`/dkg/access/1.0.0`: Agent B sees a private KA in the meta graph, sends
an AccessRequest with payment proof, receives the private triples, and
verifies the private merkle root. Already partially implemented
(`AccessHandler`, `AccessClient`); needs payment proof integration and
full e2e flow.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_PART1_MARKETPLACE.md §7](../SPEC_PART1_MARKETPLACE.md) (Private Knowledge section)
- **Diagram**: [access-flow.md](../diagrams/access-flow.md)

### 2.2 Fix agent UAL/chainId in broadcast — **DONE**
`broadcastPublish` now uses `this.chain.chainId` and builds UAL from
`result.onChainResult` (publisherAddress, startKAId). Uses `result.publicQuads`
so private triples are not re-sent over gossip.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS_AND_ISSUES.md §2.1](../SPEC_IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS_AND_ISSUES.md)

### 2.3 Paranet on-chain lifecycle — **DONE**
On-chain paranet creation and discovery via `ParanetV9Registry.sol`. EVM adapter
implements `createParanet(name, description, accessPolicy)` and
`listParanetsFromChain(fromBlock?)` when the registry is registered in the Hub.
`submitToParanet` remains a stub (Milestone 5). Deploy script `042_deploy_paranet_v9_registry.ts`;
chain types extended with `CreateParanetParams` (name/description/accessPolicy),
`ParanetOnChain`, and optional `TxResult.paranetId`.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_PARANET_LIFECYCLE.md](../specs/SPEC_PARANET_LIFECYCLE.md)

### 2.4 Capacity metering & dynamic pricing — **NEEDS SPEC** (exists as draft)
Gas-like metering for DKG resources (storage, CPU, bandwidth) with
dynamic pricing. Foundation for pay-per-query and resource-aware
node scoring.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_CAPACITY_AND_GAS.md](../SPEC_CAPACITY_AND_GAS.md) (draft)

---

- **Plan**: [PLAN_TRUST_LAYER.md §Milestone 5](./PLAN_TRUST_LAYER.md)

### 3.4 FairSwap judge (Milestone 5b) — **READY**
Trustless exchange of private knowledge via FairSwap protocol.
`FairSwapJudge.sol` with escrow, key reveal, and dispute resolution.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_TRUST_LAYER.md §5](../SPEC_TRUST_LAYER.md)
- **Plan**: [PLAN_TRUST_LAYER.md §Milestone 5b](./PLAN_TRUST_LAYER.md)

### 3.5 Permanent publishing (Milestone 5c) — **READY**
"Publish forever" with one-time fee distributed across 100 epochs.
Arweave-style endowment model with declining distribution.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_TRUST_LAYER.md §4](../SPEC_TRUST_LAYER.md)
- **Plan**: [PLAN_TRUST_LAYER.md §Milestone 5c](./PLAN_TRUST_LAYER.md)

### 3.6 Fee split & protocol treasury (Milestone 5) — **READY**

- **Deploy guide**: [DEPLOY_TESTNET.md](./DEPLOY_TESTNET.md)

### 3.8 Solana adapter (Milestone 7, future) — **NEEDS SPEC**
Anchor programs mirroring EVM contract logic. `SolanaChainAdapter`
implementing the same `ChainAdapter` interface. Zero changes to
publisher/agent/CLI.

- **Spec**: [SPEC_SOLANA_ADAPTER.md](../specs/SPEC_SOLANA_ADAPTER.md) — **TO CREATE** (when prioritized)

exploring, and managing. Phases 1–5 implemented: instrumentation + storage +
API, dashboard home + observability UI, Knowledge Explorer (SPARQL editor +
result views, paranet browser, publish, history, saved queries), Wallet &
Economics (balances, RPC health), Integrations (adapters list, skills,
paranet subscribe). Phase 6: AI assistant (rule-based chatbot) done; OTel
export interface stubbed; neural NL→SPARQL planned.

## What to implement next (recommendation)

**Current state (2026-02-22):**  
Networking & sync (persistence, sync on connect, cross-agent query) and Node UI are done. UAL/chainId in broadcast is fixed. Relay E2E test (7.1) and Paranet on-chain lifecycle (2.3) are done. CLI and node-ui builds fixed (TS action opts, Command import; Vite heap for relay). Release workflow, CHANGELOG, and release docs added. Remaining P1: Private KA access (2.1).

**Recommended order:**

1. **2.3 Paranet on-chain lifecycle** (P1) — **DONE**  
   ParanetV9Registry contract (createParanetV9, ParanetCreated event), EVM adapter createParanet/listParanetsFromChain, extended CreateParanetParams and optional listParanetsFromChain on ChainAdapter. Join/leave and node startup recovery from chain can follow.

2. **2.1 Private KA access** (P1)  
   Complete the access protocol (payment proof, full e2e). Needed for paid private knowledge and completes the publish → access loop.

3. **Then** either Trust Layer milestones (3.1–3.6) for economics, or 1.3 on-chain sync verification / 1.6 relay auto-discovery for robustness and bootstrapping.
