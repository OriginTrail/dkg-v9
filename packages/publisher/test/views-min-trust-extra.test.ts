/**
 * View resolution + `minTrust` filtering tests (P-13).
 *
 * Audit finding covered:
 *
 *   P-13 (MEDIUM) — Spec §12 GET declares that the `verified-memory`
 *                   view MUST honor `minTrust` so a caller requesting
 *                   `TrustLevel.ConsensusVerified` does NOT see triples
 *                   that only reached `TrustLevel.SelfAttested`. The
 *                   original `resolveViewGraphs(view, cgId, opts)`
 *                   signature had no `minTrust` parameter — the field
 *                   was declared on the query-engine `QueryOptions`
 *                   type, but the resolver silently ignored it.
 *
 * Fix: `resolveViewGraphs` now accepts `minTrust`. When it is set
 * above `TrustLevel.SelfAttested`, the root data graph (which holds
 * chain-confirmed SelfAttested triples) is dropped from the resolution.
 * Only quorum-verified sub-graphs under `/_verified_memory/{quorum}`
 * survive the resolution step.
 *
 * Note: per-quad trust filtering inside the surviving sub-graphs (based
 * on a `dkg:trustLevel` predicate on each triple) is tracked as Q-1 and
 * is out of scope for this test.
